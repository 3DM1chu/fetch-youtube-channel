We wanted to see if we could cram all of the guts of the UniFi Switch Aggregation into the form factor of the UniFi Dream Machine Pro - and I think it came out pretty good!  \\\\n\\\\nSTL files for 3D printing:  https://thangs.com/mythangs/file/853694\\\\n\\\\nFull list of changes:\\\\n\\\\n1. Tore down the USW-A switch completely: main PCB, power supply, AC input, screen PCBA\\\\n2. Removed the screen from the USW-A front panel. This panel is made of plastic. Applied heat to soften the adhesive. Screen is a bit delicate so there is a small chip in the glass of the screen unfortunately.\\\\n3. Removed drive cage from UDMP\\\\n4. Removed screen PCBA from UDMP\\\\n4. Removed rivet standoffs from UDMP\\\\n5. Created 3D printed bracket to hold in USW-A PCB inside UDMP\\\\n6. Drilled holes in bottom of UDMP to mount in 3D printed bracket\\\\n7. Had to Dremel out front panel of UDMP where the USW-A reset switch would be (this panel is aluminum).\\\\n8. Dremel\\xe2\\x80\\x99d out hole for second screen in UDMP. Hot glued it in.\\\\n9. Laser cut USW-A front panel SFP section and then hot glued that where UDMP drive bay was.\\\\n10. Relocated heat spreaders from bottom of USW-A housing to the UDMP.\\\\n11. Mounted USW-A PCBA on top of 3D printed brackets inside UDMP\\\\n12. Mounted screen PCBAs from both devices onto 3D printed bracket inside UDMP\\\\n13. Made a new AC input cable so the AC port would power both power supplies.\\\\n14. Dremel\\xe2\\x80\\x99d USW-A large metal heat sink so that it would fit within UDMP\\\\n15. Hot glued in USW-A power supply to the UDMP chassis.\\\\n16. 3D Printed bracket to for 2.5\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99 SSD to be relocated inside UDMP. Used SATA extension cable.\\\\n\\\\nFull credit to my buddy Tal who made this all happen!\\\\n\\\\nTimecodes:\\\\n\\\\n00:00 Intro\\\\n01:26 Dr. Frankenstein\\'s Dream Machine overview\\\\n02:08 Inside the custom Dream Machine\\\\n02:48 Switch Aggregation PCB custom 3D printing\\\\n03:21 Relocating the hard drive\\\\n04:46 Two 1.3\\\\\"",
