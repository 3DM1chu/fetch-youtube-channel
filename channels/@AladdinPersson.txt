    "desc": "How I increased my testosterone levels from 380 ng/dl (first test), 480 ng/dl (second test) to 836 ng/dl in less than a year, naturally, so about a 2x increase. After reading a few studies on how testosterone is a hormone linked to greater resilience, higher drive, physical recovery, stress tolerance, and energy levels I was intrigued to do an experiment if it would help me. Note: I did not only introduce supplements, but also improved sleep etc at the same time. Causality is hard, but I do believe the supplements have helped increase my testosterone, my estimate is at least ~200 total increase from supplements. I encourage you to do blood test before and after to confirm that it works though as I am only n=1. Evaluating your own resilience, drive, energy level etc is a lot harder and what is even harder is determining causality. I am careful to say it has made any difference for me personally: I don\\'t know, but at least I can say I am stronger in the gym :)\\\\n\\\\nMeta review mentioned in video: https://www.mdpi.com/2673-396X/2/2/11/htm\\\\nGood video on testosterone: https://youtu.be/BtHg1AJwOzs\\\\n\\\\nThe exact supplements I take (I ordered from amazon DE):\\\\nAshwaganda (500mg per capsule, 2x daily, once earlier in the day and once taken before bed): https://amzn.to/3UAWdJF\\\\nD Vitamin (5000 IU daily, taken with food): https://amzn.to/3E7T39b\\\\nZinc Bisglycinate (25mg daily): https://amzn.to/3g4UGwl\\\\nMagnesium Bisglycinate (300mg, 2 capsules before bed): https://amzn.to/3TC344n\\\\nCreatine Monohydrate (5g a day): https://amzn.to/3UzPkrP\\\\nFenugreek (650 mg a day, 2 capsules): https://amzn.to/3AeLNHj\\\\nBoron (6 to 9mg a day, 2-3 capsules): https://amzn.to/3hA3SJr\\\\nFadogia Agrestis (300 to 600mg daily, 1-2 capsules): https://amzn.to/3UVqrqx\\\\nTongkat Ali (500mg daily, 1 capsule): https://amzn.to/3EFJmR3\\\\n\\\\nI also take these for improved sleep:\\\\nL-theanine (200-400mg, ~30 minutes before bed): https://amzn.to/3trKwsM\\\\nMelatonin (0.5mg, ~30 minutes before bed, I use maybe 3x a week): https://amzn.to/3Ah7HK9\\\\nMagnesium bisglycinate(~ 30 minutes before bed): mentioned above already\\\\nApigenin (50mg, 1 capsule, ~ 30 minutes before bed): https://amzn.to/3gbSTFI\\\\n\\\\nOthers:\\\\nOmega 3 (4-5 capsules, 2-2.5gram EPA a day, note this is not triglyceride formula so take with foods and store in freezer/fridge): https://amzn.to/3hHZMPs\\\\nIcing testicles (free): 15 min/day before bed while reading.
