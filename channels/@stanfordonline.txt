This poses a challenge for leveraging them in robotics, which requires interactive decision making and reasoning for a given embodiment. This talk will discuss several research directions towards addressing these challenges, from grounding them in their environment (SayCan, InnerMonologue, Grounded Decoding, NL-Maps), to directly outputting grounded code (Code as Policies), and finally training them with embodied robotics data (PaLM-E, RT-1). \\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\nBrian is a Research Scientist with Google Brain (or Deepmind now) where he works on the Robotics team. Generally, his research interests lie in enabling mobile robotic systems to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in real-world environments through machine learning -- and in the last couple years, foundation models.

This talk suggests that key to unlocking sustainable roadways is to shift the focus from autonomy-driven design to use-driven design. Based on recent work, the talk focuses on three critical priorities\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xe2\\x80\\x93safety, cost, and environment\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xe2\\x80\\x93each leveraging the \\'autonomy\\' capability of coordinating vehicles. But fully autonomous agents are not the only entities that can coordinate. A paragon of safety is air traffic control, in which expert operators remotely coordinate aircraft. The work brings these ideas to the dense traffic on roadways and analyzes the scalability of operators. Another much cheaper way to coordinate is to give a smartphone app to drivers. The work characterizes how well lower-tech systems can still achieve autonomous capabilities. For cleaner roadways, dozens of articles have considered coordinating vehicles to reduce emissions. This work models whether doing so would move the needle on climate change mitigation goals. To study these multi-agent coordination problems, the work leverages queueing theory, Lyapunov stability analysis, transfer learning, and multi-task reinforcement learning. The talk will also substantiate issues of robustness that arise when applying learning-based techniques and a new line of work designed to address them. Overall, the results indicate promise for intelligent coordination to enable sustainable roadways.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nCathy Wu works at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and large-scale urban systems and other societal systems. Her recent research focuses on mixed autonomy systems in mobility, which studies the complex integration of automation such as self-driving cars into existing urban systems. She is broadly interested in developing principled computational tools to enable reliable and complex decision-making for critical societal systems.

These creatures have successfully tackled the challenges of miniaturization, multifunctionality, and multiplicity, which are critical factors in the development of small-scale robotic systems. By creating these abilities in mesoscale robots, we can unlock a vast array of applications. For instance, we could build artificial multi-locomotion swarms to explore and monitor diverse physical environments with high task efficiency or design compact and distributed haptic actuators to simulate compelling human touch interactions in virtual environments with high fidelity and minimal encumbrance. However, conventional design methods for creating miniature yet multifunctional robots are limited due to constraints in downsizing classical electric motors, transmission gears, and mechanisms. Additionally, increasing the number of components requires meticulous manual assembly processes. In this talk, I will delve into how multimaterial layer composition and folding (origami robotics) and 3D printing can enable miniature, multifunctional, and mass-manufacturable robots. I will provide insights into a systematic design methodology that breaks down mesoscale robot design in terms of mechanisms, geometry, materials, and fabrication, highlighting their relation and challenges. I will demonstrate unique robotic platforms built on this paradigm, including Tribots, 10-gram palm-sized multi-locomotion origami robots that jump, roll, and crawl to traverse uneven terrains and manipulate objects collectively, as well as shape-morphing grippers and structures. These robots use functional materials like shape memory alloy and fluids to achieve tunable power, compact actuators, and mechanisms. Additionally, I will present my latest research on monolithically 3D-printed, soft finger and wrist-worn haptic displays called FingerPrint and Hoxels.

    "desc": "April 14, 2023\\\\nTobias Gerstenberg of Stanford University\\\\n\\\\nAs humans, we spend much of our time going beyond the here and now. We dwell on the past, long for the future, and ponder how things could have turned out differently. The capacity to simulate counterfactual possibilities is an important feat of human cognition. Counterfactuals are critical for how people make causal judgments, how they explain what happened, and how they hold others responsible for their actions. To simulate counterfactuals, we need three key ingredients: a generative mental model of the world, the ability to perform counterfactual interventions on that model, and the capacity to simulate what the consequences of these interventions would have been. I introduce the counterfactual simulation model (CSM) which incorporates these ingredients and applies them to capturing people\\'s intuitive understanding of the physical and psychological world. In the physical domain, the CSM predicts people\\'s causal judgments about a variety of physical scenes, including dynamic collision events, complex situations that involve multiple causes, omissions as causes, and causal responsibility for a system\\'s stability. It also captures the cognitive processes that underlie these judgments as revealed by spontaneous eye-movements. People not only look at what actually happened; they spontaneously simulate whether the outcome in the counterfactual situation would have been different. In the psychological domain, the CSM explains what agent\\'s actions made a difference to the outcome, whether one agent helped or hindered another, and how responsible different agents are for a joint outcome. Together these results demonstrate that much of human thought can be understood as cognitive operations over mental models, and that counterfactual simulation, in particular, plays a critical role in how humans make sense of the world.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nTobias Gerstenberg is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. He leads the Causality in Cognition Lab. The CiCL studies the role of causality in people\\'s understanding of the world, and of each other. Professor Gerstenberg\\'s research is highly interdisciplinary. It combines ideas from philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and the legal sciences to better understand higher-level cognitive phenomena such as causal inferences and moral judgments. The CiCL\\'s research uses a variety of methods that include computational modeling, online experiments, eye-tracking experiments, as well as developmental studies with children. Professor Gerstenberg\\'s work has appeared in top journals including Psychological Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Psychological Science, Cognitive Psychology, Cognition, and Cognitive Science.\"",

While initially carried in our hands and pockets, mobile technologies are changing form to fit our lifestyles, enabling interactions on-body (e.g., wearables) and out-of-body (e.g., robots and drones). Yet, much work is needed for them to make sense of complex human situations and enable symbiotic integration of man and machine. My research explores the design, development, and evaluation of natural techniques for on- and out-of-body experience, using a human-centered approach, and exploring diverse form factors and modalities towards human-machine co-existence. In this talk, I will present how we can leverage techniques at the intersection between technology and design to build novel interaction techniques. I will then highlight how interfaces are traditionally bound by form factor, so that on-body ones cater for wearables that remain on the person\\'s body while out-of-body interfaces are built to interact at arm\\'s reach. Finally, I will describe opportunities for future technology development by transitioning between the two states, therefore enabling novel applications, such as extending one\\'s physical abilities.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nDr. Jessica Cauchard is an assistant professor in the department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, where she founded and heads the Magic Lab.

    "desc": "March 10, 2023\\\\nJoel Burdick of Caltech\\\\n\\\\nAutonomous robots are increasing applied to tasks that involve complex maneuvers and dynamic environments that are difficult to model a priori. Various types of learning methods have been proposed to fill this modeling gap. To motivate the need for learning complex fluid-structure interactions, we first review the SQUID (a ballistically launched and self-stabilizing drone) and PARSEC (an aerial manipulator that can deliver self-anchoring sensor network modules) systems. Next we show how to learn basic fluid-structure interactions using Koopman spectral techniques, and incorporate the learned model into a real-time nonlinear model predictive control framework. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on small drones that operate very close to the ground, where the ground effect normally destabilizes flight. Operational risk abounds in complex robotic tasks. This risk arises both from the uncertain environment, and from incompletely learned models. After reviewing the basics of coherent risk measures, we will show how simple risk aware terrain analysis improved the performance of our legged and wheeled robots in the DARPA Subterranean challenge. Then we will introduce an on-line method to learn the dynamics of an apriori unknown dynamical obstacle, and robustly avoid the obstacle using a novel risk-based, distributionally robust, chance constraints derived from the evolving learned model. We then introduce the concept of risk surfaces to enable fast on-line learning of a priori unknown dynamical disturbances, and show how this approach can adapt a drone to wind disturbances with only 45 seconds of on-line data gathering.\"",

However, despite a sustained boom in robotics research over the last decade, the number of places we\\'ve seen robotics in use for these tasks has been uninspiring. Successful commercialization of autonomous robots have required significant human scaffolding through teleoperation, and incredible amounts of capital, to achieve, and despite this are still limited by brittle systems and hand-engineered components. The reality seems to be that these tasks are not nearly as dull as they might seem on the surface, and instead require ingenuity for success some small but critical fraction of the time. In this talk, I focus on my recent investigation into where the limits of autonomy are for the highly sought-after application to subterranean emergency response operations. This application was motivated by the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, which just last year concluded with the CU Boulder team \\'MARBLE\\' taking third place and winning a $500,000 prize. In this talk, I will give an overview into the genesis of our solution over three years of effort, especially with respect to mobility, autonomy, perception, and communications.

What drew me in was the concept that you could specify a goal or objective for a robot, and it would be able to figure out on its own how to sequence actions in order to achieve it. In other words, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to hand-engineer the robot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it emerges from optimal decision making. Throughout my career in robotics and AI, it has always felt satisfying when the robot would autonomously generate a strategy that I felt was the right way to solve the task, and it was even better when the optimal solution would take me a bit by surprise. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntro to AI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I share with students an example of this, where a mobile robot figures out it can avoid getting stuck in a pit by moving along the edge. In my group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research, we tackle the problem of enabling robots to coordinate with and assist people: for example, autonomous cars driving among pedestrians and human-driven vehicles, or robot arms helping people with motor impairments (together with UCSF Neurology). And time and time again, what has sparked the most joy for me is when robots figure out their own strategies that lead to good interaction \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when, as in the work your very own faculty Dorsa Sadigh did in her PhD, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to hand-engineer that an autonomous car should inch forward at a 4-way stop to assert its turn. Instead, the behavior emerges from optimal decision making. So for this seminar, I\\'d like to step back a bit. Rather than going through one particular piece of research, I will take the opportunity to share what I\\'ve found the underlying optimal decision making problem formulation is for HRI -- and reflect on how we\\'ve set up optimal decision making problems that require the robot to account for the people it is interacting with, along with the surprising strategies that have emerged from that along the way. This has come back full circle for me, as I got to include some of this perspective in the very book that drew me into the field, by editing the robotics chapter for the 4th edition of AIMA.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nI am an Associate Professor in the EECS Department at UC Berkeley. My goal is to enable robots to work with, around, and in support of people. I run the InterACT Lab, where we focus on algorithms for human-robot interaction -- algorithms that move beyond the robot\\'s function in isolation, and generate robot behavior that coordinates well with people, and is aligned with what we actually want the robot to do. We work across different applications, from assistive arms, to quadrotors, to autonomous cars, and draw from optimal control, game theory, reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, and cognitive science.

Vera Liao of Microsoft Research\\\\n\\\\nArtificial Intelligence technologies are increasingly used to aid human decisions and perform autonomous tasks in critical domains. The need to understand AI in order to improve, contest, develop appropriate trust, and better interact with AI systems has spurred great academic and public interest in Explainable AI (XAI). The technical field of XAI has produced a vast collection of algorithms in recent years. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are increasingly important especially as practitioners begin to leverage XAI algorithms to build XAI applications. In this talk, I will draw on my own research and broad HCI works to highlight the central role that human-centered approaches should play in shaping XAI technologies, including driving technical choices by understanding users\\' explainability needs, uncovering pitfalls of existing XAI methods, and providing conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nQ.

Towards a goal of more human-centered computing, I believe that interaction must be grounded in the physical world and leverage our innate abilities for spatial cognition and dexterous manipulation with our hands. By creating interfaces that allow for richer physical interaction, such as bimanual, whole hand haptic exploration, these systems can help people with different abilities (e.g., children, people with visual impairments, or even expert designers) better understand and interact with information. The first part of my talk will discuss a central challenge in the widespread adoption of such haptic user interfaces \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how can we create physical interactive displays that update dynamically, and what are the interaction techniques and enabling technologies necessary to support such systems?

Carefully designed data rendering and interface affordances can help significantly.

Warning systems are thus designed to provide alerts when an unsafe situation is imminent (in the absence of corrective action), with the objective of issuing alerts as quickly as possible when there is a problem (i.e. they should be sample-efficient). They should also come with statistical guarantees ensuring that whenever there is an unsafe situation, the warning system will detect it (i.e. a low false negative rate) or that not too many false alarms will be issued (a low false positive rate). In this talk, I will present warning systems for two types of situations. First, I will introduce a real-time warning system framework that can detect unsafe situations when there is no distribution shift. We provide a guarantee on the false negative rate (i.e. of the situations that are unsafe, fewer than epsilon will occur without an alert) using very few samples (only 1/epsilon), and we empirically observe low false detection (positive) rates. Second, I will present a warning system for identifying distribution shifts. Our method is capable of detecting these distribution shifts up to 11x faster than prior work on realistic robotics settings, while providing a high probability guarantee against false alarms. We empirically observe low false negative rates (whenever there is a distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert).\\\\n\\\\n#robotics\"",

    "desc": "Mrdjan Jankovic of Ford Research\\\\nJanuary 13, 2023\\\\n\\\\nIn everyday driving, many traffic maneuvers such as merges, lane changes, passing through an intersection, require negotiation between independent actors/agents. The same is true for mobile robots autonomously operating in a space open to other agents (e.g., humans, robots, etc.). Negotiation is an inherently difficult concept to code into a software algorithm. It has been observed in computer simulations that some \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecentralized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d algorithms produce gridlocks while others never do. It has turned out that gridlocking algorithms create locally stable equilibria in the joint inter-agent space, while, for those that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gridlock, equilibria are unstable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hence the title of the talk.\\\\n\\\\nWe use Control Barrier Function (CBF) based methods to provide collision avoidance guarantees. The main advantage of CBFs is that they result in relatively easier to solve convex programs even for nonlinear system dynamics and inherently non-convex obstacle avoidance problems. Six different CBF-based control policies were compared for collision avoidance and liveness (fluidity of motion, absence of gridlocks) on a 5-agent, holonomic-robot system. The outcome was then correlated with stability analysis on a simpler, yet representative problem. The results are illustrated by extensive simulations and a vehicle experiment with stationary obstacles.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:49 Objective - unstable feedback loop? ord\\\\n2:43 Why CBFs?

A common anti-pattern is overlooking the dynamic, complex, and unexpected ways humans interact with AI, which in turn limits the adoption and usage of AI in practical contexts. To address this, I argue that human-AI interaction should be considered a first-class object in designing AI applications.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I present a few novel interactive systems that use AI to support complex real-life tasks. I discuss tensions and solutions in designing human-AI interaction, and critically reflect on my own research to share hard-earned design lessons. Factors such as accuracy disparity between user groups, user motivation, social dynamics, and sustainable engagement often play a crucial role in determining the user experience of AI, even more so than model accuracy. My call to action is that we need to establish robust building blocks for   Interaction-Centric AI    a systematic approach to designing and engineering human-AI interaction that complements and overcomes the limitations of model- and data-centric views.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\nJuho Kim [juhokim.com] is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at KAIST, affiliate faculty in the Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at KAIST, and a director of KIXLAB (the KAIST Interaction Lab) [kixlab.org].

From caring for older adults to supporting workers in service industries, collaborative robots hold incredible potential to improve the quality of life for millions of people. These robots need to be safe, intuitive and simple to use. They need to be affordable enough to allow widespread access and adoption. Ultimately, acceptance of these robots in society will require that the human experience is at the center of their design. In this presentation I will highlight some of my work to humanize robot design over the last two decades. This work includes compliant and safe actuation for humanoids, low-cost collaborative robot arms, and assistive mobile manipulators. Our recent work at Hello Robot has been to commercialize a mobile manipulator named Stretch that can assist older adults and people with disabilities. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll detail the human-centered research and development process behind Stretch and present recent work to allow an individual with quadriplegia to control Stretch for everyday tasks.

Some environments, however, are challenging to access because of distance, scale, and limitations of the body itself. In many of these situations, access can be effectively restored via a telerobot. Dexterous manipulation through a telerobot is possible only if the telerobot can accurately relay any sensory feedback resulting from its interactions in the environment to the operator. In this talk, I will discuss recent work from our lab focused on the application of haptic feedback in various telerobotic applications. I will begin by describing findings from recent investigations comparing different haptic feedback and autonomous control approaches for upper-extremity prosthetic limbs, as well as the cognitive load of haptic feedback in these prosthetic devices.

In this talk I will describe the adaptive circuit compression algorithm [1] developed by\\\\nour group and implemented in the SQUANDER package [2]. We scaled up the scope of our\\\\nquantum compiler to synthesize circuits up to 9 qubits solely from the unitary associated\\\\nwith the quantum program. Such capabilities were not demonstrated before by any\\\\noptimization based quantum gate synthesis tool. This significant improvement was achieved\\\\nby the utilization of a data-flow engine (DFE) based quantum computer simulator, developed\\\\nin the collaboration of the E\\xc3\\xb6tv\\xc3\\xb6s Lor\\xc3\\xa1nd University and the Wigner Research Center\\\\n(Hungary), Maxeler Technologies and Groq. The quantum computer simulator was designed\\\\nto simulate arbitrary quantum circuit consisting of single qubit rotations and controlled\\\\ntwo-qubit gates on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips. In our benchmark\\\\ncomparison with the QISKIT package, the circuits produced by the SQUANDER package (with\\\\nthe DFE accelerator support) were compressed by 97% in average, while the fidelity of the\\\\ncircuits were still close to unity by an error of $10^{-4}$. In the talk I will also discuss\\\\npossibilities to further improve the synthesis procedure and scale up our approach to higher\\\\nnumber of qubits.\\\\n\\\\n[1] P. Rakyta, Z.

    "desc": "Veronica Santos of UCLA\\\\nNovember 11, 2022\\\\n\\\\nCompared to vision, the complementary sense of touch has yet to be broadly integrated into robotic systems that physically interact with the world. An artificial sense of touch is especially useful when vision is limited or unavailable. In this presentation, I will highlight our work on task-driven efforts to endow robots with tactile perception capabilities for human-robot interaction, remote work in harsh environments, and the manipulation of deformable objects. Real-time tactile perception and decision-making capabilities could be used to advance semi-autonomous robot systems and reduce the cognitive burden on human teleoperators. With advances in haptic display technologies, interfaces with the human body, and networking capabilities, however, touch can be used for more than completing novel tasks. Touch can enhance social connections from afar, enable the inclusion of marginalized groups in community activities, and create new opportunities for remote work involving social and physical interactions. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\n Veronica Santos is a Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Director of the UCLA Biomechatronics Lab (http://biomechatronics.ucla.edu). She currently serves as the Associate Dean of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and Faculty Affairs for the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. Dr. Santos earned her B.S. in mechanical engineering (music minor) from UC Berkeley, was a Quality and R\\\\u0026D Engineer at Guidant Corporation, and earned her M.S. and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering (biometry minor) from Cornell University. As a postdoc at the University of Southern California, she contributed to the development of a bio-inspired tactile sensor for prosthetic hands before moving to Arizona State University as an Assistant Professor. Her research interests include hand biomechanics, human-machine systems, tactile sensing and perception, and prosthetics/robotics for grasp and manipulation. Dr. Santos was selected for an NSF CAREER Award, the U.S. Defense Science Study Group, a U.S. National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering Education Symposium, and numerous teaching awards. Her work has appeared in TechCrunch and Forbes, among others. Dr. Santos has served as an ICRA Editor and IEEE Haptics Symposium Editor-in-Chief, among other duties.

    "desc": "Haiyi Zhu of CMU HCII\\\\nNovember 4, 2022\\\\nBridging AI and HCI: Incorporating Human Values into the Development of AI Technologies\\\\n\\\\nThe increasing accuracy and falling costs of AI have stimulated the increased use of AI technologies in mainstream user-facing applications and services. However, there is a disconnect between mathematically rigorous AI approaches and the human stakeholders needs, motivations, and values, as well as organizational and institutional realities, contexts, and constraints; this disconnect is likely to undermine practical initiatives and may sometimes lead to negative societal impacts. In this presentation, I will discuss my research on incorporating human stakeholders desires and values, as well as organizational and social contexts, into the creation process of AI technologies. I will describe a series of projects to illustrate my approach. I hope this presentation will contribute to the rich ongoing conversation concerning bridging HCI and AI and using HCI methods to address AI challenges.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\nI am the Daniel P. Siewiorek Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I received a B.S in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University. I have received multiple NSF awards (CRII, Cyber Human System, EAGER on AI and Society, Fairness in AI, and Smart and Connected Communities), several paper awards in venues such as CHI, CSCW, and Human Factors, and an Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Check out our entire catalog of courses and programs: https://online.stanford.edu/explore\"",

    "desc": "Scrutiny as Spectacle: Social Media Scrutiny of Frontline Professionals and its Implications for Accountability\\\\n\\\\nArvind Karunakaran of Stanford University\\\\n\\\\nOctober 28, 2022\\\\n\\\\nProfessional accountability is considered important to the sustenance of a profession. Prior research has examined the role that scrutiny by constituents, such as supervisors, regulators, auditors, advocacy groups, and certification bodies, plays in improving professional accountability. With the advent of social media, a diverse and dispersed public can now scrutinize the actions of professionals, especially those at the frontline. In this research, I examine how social media scrutiny from the public impacts the professional accountability of frontline professionals and its implications for both technology design and organizational policies. Based on longitudinal field work in multiple settings (emergency management, healthcare), I elaborate on how and under what conditions social media scrutiny of frontline professionals (e.g., 911 call-takers, triage nurses) can obscure rather than improve professional accountability. I describe the processes that produce these paradoxical outcomes and conclude by discussing the consequences both intended and unintended of enacting scrutiny as a form of spectacle.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\n\\\\nArvind Karunakaran is an Assistant Professor of Management Science \\\\u0026 Engineering at Stanford University. His research examines authority and accountability at work in the context of technological change. Drawing on organizational theory and the sociology of work \\\\u0026 professions, his current research focuses on the mechanisms and processes for holding professional groups accountable for their actions, especially during periods of change. He received his Ph.D. from MIT Sloan School of Management, and his research is published in Administrative Science Quarterly, Organization Science, Research Policy, and Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology.\"",

    "desc": "Tae Myung Huh of UC Santa Cruz\\\\nOctober 28, 2022\\\\n\\\\nDespite some successful demonstrations, bringing robots into our everyday lives still remains a challenge. One of the major hurdles is the sensing of contact conditions. Contact conditions profoundly affect how the robot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions will affect interaction forces between it and its objects, surfaces, or even other agents that it comes into contact with. Part of the motivation to monitor these interactions and how they change is that they are not entirely predictable; contact conditions and forces can change continuously or discontinuously over the course of a task. To react adequately to these kinds of changes, the robot needs tactile sensors. These tactile sensors provide unique contact information, such as contact force, location, and slips, which enables adaptive robotic control in changing contact conditions. In this talk, I mainly present two tactile sensing studies on dexterous manipulation and suction cup grasping. The first concerns tactile sensing with friction-based contacts for sliding manipulation. I will present a multimodal tactile sensor that measures local normal/shear stress as well as directional (linear and rotational) slips. This information is useful for in-hand object manipulations. The second concerns tactile sensing for suction cup grasping. The smart suction cup monitors local suction seal formations and enables haptic exploration and grip monitoring during grasping and forceful manipulation.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\nTae Myung Huh received his B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in 2014 from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering in 2016 and 2020 from Stanford University, Stanford, CA. His research interests include robotic tactile sensors, perception of grasping, and machine learning. \\\\n\\\\nIn his Ph.D. study, he developed a small legged robot with capacitive force sensors on its feet, tactile sensors for measuring contact of gecko adhesive grippers, and a compact multiaxial/multimodal tactile sensor for industrial grippers. His publications can be found in this link (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=drakQU4AAAAJ\\\\u0026hl=en\\\\u0026oi=ao).\\\\nLearn more here: https://edg.berkeley.edu/people/tae-myung-huh/\\\\n\\\\n#robotics\"",

Concurrent systems need a lot of hand-holding to even learn a single cognitive concept or a dexterous skill, say \\xe2\\x80\\x9copen a door\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, let alone generalizing to new windows and cupboards! This is far from our vision of everyday robots! would require a broader concept of generalization and continual update of representations. This study of the science of embodied AI opens three key questions: (a) Representational biases \\\\u0026 Causal inference for interactive decision making, (b) Perceptual representations learned by and for interaction, (c) Systems and abstractions for scalable learning. This talk will focus on decision-making uncovering the many facets of inductive biases in off-policy reinforcement learning in robotics. I will introduce C-Learning to trade off-speed and reliability instead of vanilla Q-Learning. Then I will talk about the discovery of latent causal structure to improve sample efficiency. Moving on from skills, we will describe task graphs for hierarchically structured tasks for manipulation. I will present how to scale structured learning in robot manipulation with Roboturk, and finally, prescribe a practical algorithm for deployment with safety constraints. Taking a step back, I will end with notions of structure in Embodied AI for both perception and decision making.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\n\\\\nAnimesh Garg is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Toronto and a Faculty Member at the Vector Institute.

Using Menlo as a case study, we find that ethics governance-in-the-making is composed of processes that combine controversies of ethics and justice in the co-production of technoscience and society, the everyday ethics work of actors engaged in scientific and technical practice, and ethics as a form of governance in scientific and technical communities. Interviews with authors and analysis of the Menlo Report documents reveal a story of marshalling human and financial resources from a particular subfield within ICT research    network measurement and network security research    to close controversies worrying both researchers and funders. To create the Menlo Report, authors and funders relied on bricolage work with existing, available resources, significantly shaping both the report  s contents and impacts. Report authors were motivated by both forward- and backward-looking goals: enabling new data sharing as well as addressing the status of a research record thrown into ethical question by controversial studies. Authors also grappled with uncertainty about when ethical frameworks were appropriate and made the decision to classify much network data as human subjects data. Finally, the Menlo Report authors attempted to enroll multiple networks in governance through appeals to local research communities as well as taking steps towards federal rulemaking. This analysis of the Menlo Report suggests analytical lenses for study of current and future ethics governance in computer science. The Menlo Report serves as a case study in how to study ethics governance-in-the-making: with attention to resources, adaptation and bricolage, and with a focus on both the uncertainties the process tries to repair, as well as the new uncertainties the process uncovers, which will become the site of future ethics work.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speakers: \\\\nMegan Finn is an Associate Professor at the Information School at University of Washington where she teaches about information policy and ethics.

In this talk, I\\'ll present our recent efforts in building neural representations that are object-centric and multi-sensory---two properties that are essential for flexible, efficient, and generalizable robot manipulation. I\\'ll focus on four aspects: technical innovations in building such representations, advances in scaling them up in the form of a multi-sensory neural object dataset, methods for inferring category-agnostic neural object representations and their parameters (SysID) from unlabeled visual data, and systems that adopt these representations for robotic manipulation.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: \\\\nI am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, affiliated with the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL) and the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL).

    "desc": "October 7, 2022\\\\nDakuo Wang of MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab\\\\n\\\\nHuman-Centered AI (HCAI) refers to the research effort that aims to design and implement AI techniques to support various human tasks, while taking human needs into consideration and preserving human control. Prior work has focused on proposing human-AI interaction design guidelines and explainable AI (XAI) methods, but, why do some human-centered AI systems work, and some still not in the real world? In this talk, I show how we can learn from the research about human-human collaborations to guide the design and development of AI systems for a human-AI collaboration paradigm. This series of works serves as a cornerstone towards the ultimate future of Human-AI Collaboration, where AI and humans can take complementary and indispensable roles, and together to achieve a better experience and outcome and experience.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:\\\\nDakuo Wang is a Research Staff Member at IBM Research, Principal Investigator at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and Adjunct Professor at Northeastern University. His research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), and computer-supported team collaboration (CSCW), with a focus on the exploration, development, and evaluation of human-centered AI (HCAI) systems. The overarching research goal is to democratize AI for every person and every organization, so that they can easily access AI and collaborate with AI to accomplish real-world tasks better -- the   human-AI collaboration   paradigm. Before joining IBM Research, Dakuo got his Ph.D. from the University of California Irvine (how people write together now co-advised by Judith Olson and Gary Olson). He has worked as a designer, researcher, and engineer in the U.S., China, and France. He has served in various organizing committees, program committees, and editorial boards for conferences and journals, and ACM has recognized him as an ACM Distinguished Speaker.\\\\n\\\\n#hci\"",

Recent advances in tactile sensing hardware have resulted -- for the first time -- in the availability of mass-produced, high-resolution, inexpensive, and reliable tactile sensors. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of creating a new computational field of Touch processing dedicated to the processing and understanding of touch, similarly to what computer vision is for vision. This new field will present significant challenges both in terms of research and engineering. To start addressing some of these challenges, I will introduce our open-source ecosystem dedicated to touch sensing research. Finally, I will present some applications of touch in robotics and discuss other future applications.\\\\n\\\\nMore about the speaker:\\\\nRoberto Calandra is a Research Scientist at Facebook AI Research. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley (US) in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory (BAIR) working with Sergey Levine. His education includes a Ph.D. from TU Darmstadt (Germany) under the supervision of Jan Peters and Marc Deisenroth, a M.Sc. in Machine Learning and Data Mining from the Aalto university (Finland), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Universit\\xc3\\xa0 degli studi di Palermo (Italy). His scientific interests are broadly at the conjunction of Decision-making, Robotics and Machine Learning. Research topics that he is currently developing include Model-based Reinforcement Learning, Tactile Sensing, Morphology Adaptation, and Bayesian Optimization.\\\\n\\\\n#robotics\"",

Combatting these inequities requires understanding not only how a person interacts with an interface, but how that interaction fits into a broader ecosystem. This talk will describe two areas my group is working in. The first examines dark patterns and profiling via empirical studies in three domains: consumer behavior in online purchasing, algorithmic affinity profiling in targeted advertising, and AI -powered tools for accessibility. I will reflect on who might be harmed by misleading or deceptive design and who should be responsible for addressing it. The second focuses on online harassment and social media governance. I will present results from multiple user studies of perceptions of harm associated with online harassment, especially from groups who are typically overlooked in governance decisions.\\\\n\\\\nMore about the speaker:\\\\nSarita Schoenebeck is an Associate Professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. In Fall 2022 she is also an Adjunct at the UM Law School. Her research examines social and technical approaches to creating more safe and equitable experiences online. She is the recipient of the NSF CAREER award, Best Paper and Honorable Mention awards at CHI and CSCW, and ACM CSCW and UMSI Service awards. Her research has been covered in The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, and elsewhere. She is a Fellow at the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Yale Information Society Project, and the Yale Justice Collaboratory.

This talk will present 3 of my papers as a case study done, on how we can leverage powerfulness of Transformers, with that of representation learning, signal processing and clustering. For the first part, we would discuss how were able to beat wildly popular wavenet architecture, proposed by Google-DeepMind in raw audio synthesis. We would also show how we overcame, the quadratic constraint of the Transformers by conditioning on the context itself. Secondly, a version of Audio Transformers for large scale audio understanding, which is inspired by viT, operating on raw waveforms is presented. It combines powerful ideas from traditional signal processing, aka wavelets on intermediate transformer embeddings to produce state of the art results. Investigating into the front-end to see why they do so well, we show they learn auditory filter-bank which in a way adapts time-frequency representation according to a task which makes machine listening really cool. Finally, for the third part, the powerfulness of operating on latent code, and discuss language modeling on continuous audio signals using discrete tokens will be discussed. This will describe how simple unsupervised tasks can give us strong competitive results compared with that of end-to-end supervision.

This includes models like 2D convnets and more recent Vision Transformer models, which scale well on images but can be challenging to apply to other data. In this talk, I\\'ll be describing Perceivers, a new family of architectures that scale well to many kinds of high-dimensional data while making essentially no domain assumptions. Perceivers leverage an asymmetric attention mechanism to encode and decode data from a latent bottleneck. This mechanism allows Perceivers to handle inputs and outputs several orders of magnitude larger than can be used with standard Transformers. Using this architecture, we obtain performance comparable to or better than domain-specific architectures on a wide range of tasks, including image classification, natural language understanding, optical flow, multimodal autoencoding \\\\u0026 classification, set processing, and multi-task learning.\\\\n\\\\nDrew Jaegle is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind.

The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages.

This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.\\\\n\\\\nAditya Grover is a research scientist in the Core ML team at Facebook AI Research, a visiting postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, and an incoming assistant professor of computer science at UCLA.

While haptic devices aim to bridge this gap by simulating the sensation of touch, there are many hardware limitations that make realistic touch interactions in VR challenging. In my research, I explore how by understanding human perception, we can design VR interactions that not only overcome the current limitations of VR hardware, but also extend our abilities beyond what is possible in the real world. In this talk, I will present my work on redirection illusions that leverage the limits of human perception to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, such as improving the position accuracy of drones, the speed of tabletop robots, and the resolution of shape displays when used for haptics in VR. I will then present a framework I have developed through the lens of sensorimotor control theory to argue for the exploration and evaluation of VR interactions that go beyond mimicking reality.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker: Parastoo Abtahi is a final year computer science PhD candidate and a Gerald J. Lieberman fellow at Stanford University, where she is co-advised by Prof. James Landay and Prof. Sean Follmer. Her research area is human-computer interaction (HCI) and she works broadly on virtual reality interactions and spatial computing. Her research has been published at top HCI venues, such as the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) and the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Symposium (UIST), and has received two honorable mention paper awards. Her work has been supported by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, the Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program, and the VMware fellowship. Prior to Stanford, Parastoo received her bachelor\\'s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto as part of the Engineering Science program.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-program\"",

Humans are spending significantly more time in the digital world, however, and are increasingly interacting with people and objects through a digital medium. Unfortunately, digital interactions remain unsatisfying and limited, representing the human as having only two sensory inputs: visual and auditory.

    "desc": "Griffin Dietz of Stanford University\\\\nMay 13, 2022\\\\n\\\\nIn recent years, we have seen a growing push for computing education for all children, yet computational thinking, programming, and AI education reaches only a fraction of young learners, in part because relevant educational tools often require expensive hardware or do not align with the cognitive skills and abilities (e.g., literacy) of young users. To fill these gaps we must both understand the developmental capacities of children to reason about and engage with computing concepts and design educational platforms that support age-appropriate learning. In this talk, I describe my research that 1) studies the ways that children intuitively think about everyday technology and their abilities to reason in a computational way, 2) understands the non-pedagogical needs of learners aiming to engage with this material, and 3) applies this knowledge to the design and development of accessible, approachable, and engaging systems for computing education.\\\\n\\\\nI will describe three projects. The first is a voice-driven application to introduce key computing concepts to children, and a multimodal extension to that system that scaffolds computational practices as well. Collectively, these systems demonstrate the capacity for voice-based interfaces to deliver just-in-time pedagogy to independent at-home learners, leading to greater system understanding and higher quality code. This project, however, opens questions about how children conceive of the voice-driven interfaces they increasingly interact with. In the second project, I describe an experimental behavioral study that demonstrates how children age 3-8 might extend their cognitive capacities to reason about humans in order to reason about virtual assistants. This research demonstrates a need for education around AI and machine learning in K-12 education, so in the third project, I describe a system for middle school reinforcement learning education in a virtual robotics context. This system develops student understanding of reinforcement learning, shows high levels of engagement, and inspires young users to want to learn more about machine learning.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-program\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n1:10 Learners Still Lack Access to Computing Education\\\\n1:38 Interdisciplinary Approach Designing and Developing Computing Education Tools\\\\n2:04 Thesis Statement\\\\n3:04 Roadmap\\\\n4:03 Existing Solutions Bypass Literacy\\\\n4:26 Early Tools Support Concepts without Practices\\\\n5:37 Computing and Storytelling By Voice\\\\n6:12 Computational Learning Goals For the K-2 Grade Band\\\\n6:43 Storytelling Learning Goals For K-2 Language Comprehension\\\\n7:07 Needfinding with Educators and Students\\\\n7:27 Three Key Design Goals\\\\n8:40 Six Voice-based User Flows Storytelling\\\\n8:57 Create a Story Scaffolded Decomposition, Abstraction, and Planning\\\\n11:57 Each Child Told Three Stories\\\\n13:34 Computing Recognition Task Scratch Animation Context\\\\n15:35 Voice Interfaces Present Memory Challenges\\\\n23:22 Instruction More Impactful in Scratch Jr\\\\n24:43 Visual StoryCoder Yields Higher-Quality Stories\\\\n27:56 Humans Can Robustly Reason About Agents\\\\n29:18 Drawings Contain Human Features Before Age 6\\\\n31:47 Typical Trajectory of False Belief Understanding Where will Rachel look for her raisins?\\\\n34:56 Responses Follow False Belief Trajectory\\\\n40:17 ARtonomous Training Autonomous Navigation Models To Integrate with Code\"",

These systems have been highly successful in a broad range of applications, including manipulation, locomotion, human-robot interaction, and more, but they present challenging design and control problems. In this talk, I will share efforts from my group to expand the capabilities of compliant and origami robots to dynamical tasks. I will show how the compliance of a mechanism can be designed to produce a particular mechanical response, how we can leverage these designs for better performance and simpler control, and how we approach these problems computationally to design new compliant robots with new capabilities such as hopping, swimming, and flight.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about the speaker: https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/cynthia-sung/\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:31 Computational Robot Design\\\\n10:08 Topology Optimization\\\\n12:53 Hybrid Aerial Vehicles\\\\n13:44 Hybrid Aerial Vehicle: System Overview\\\\n15:07 Soft Arm Optimization\\\\n16:39 Physical Validation\\\\n24:09 Design Composition\\\\n25:05 Tuning Mechanics via Geometry\\\\n31:12 Hopping on Different Terrain Types\\\\n32:14 Origami-Inspired Fabrication\\\\n34:06 Energy Storage for Origami Jumpers\\\\n35:57 Compositional Design Strategy\\\\n36:45 Compositional Design of Kinetic Origami Robots\\\\n41:32 Compactness\\\\n46:25 Robot Design Approach\\\\n50:03 Control/Design for Serial Robots with Tunable Stiffness\\\\n51:33 Next Steps: Task Specification\\\\n54:40 Next Steps: Actuation\\\\n\\\\n#computationaldesign #robotics\"",

The definition, development and deployment of these systems are driven by (complex) human choices. And, as these AIs are making more and more decisions for us, and the underlying ML systems are becoming more and more complex, it is natural to ask the question: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow can you trust machine learning?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll present a framework, anchored on three pillars: Clarity, Competence and Alignment. For each, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll describe algorithmic and human processes that can help drive towards more effective, impactful and trustworthy AIs. For Clarity, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll cover methods for making the predictions of machine learning more explainable. For Competence, I will focus on methods to evaluating and testing ML models with the rigor that we apply to complex software products. Finally, for Alignment, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll describe the complexities of aligning the behaviors of an AI with the values we want to reflect in the world, along with methods that can yield more aligned outcomes.Through this discussion, we will cover both fundamental concepts and actionable algorithms and tools that can lead to increased trust in ML.\\\\n\\\\nAdditional recommended reading:\\\\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938\\\\nhttps://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/acl20_checklist.pdf\\\\nhttps://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9348821/photography-race-bias\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about the speaker: https://guestrin.su.domains/\\\\n\\\\nWatch more videos from this seminar series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNtnS3JSRRZzLWQo2dd6XNs\\\\n\\\\n#trust #machinelearning\"",

Much work on robust machine learning and control seeks to be resilient to, or completely remove the need for, human input. By contrast, my research seeks to directly and efficiently incorporate human input into the study of robust AI systems. One problem that arises when robots and other AI systems learn from human input is that there is often a large amount of uncertainty over the human\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true intent and the corresponding desired robot behavior. To address this problem, I will discuss prior and ongoing research along three main topics: \\\\n\\\\n(1) how to enable AI systems to efficiently and accurately maintain uncertainty over human intent\\\\n(2) how to generate risk-averse behaviors that are robust to this uncertainty\\\\n(3) how robots and other AI systems can efficiently query for additional human input to actively reduce uncertainty and improve their performance. \\\\n\\\\nMy talk will conclude with a discussion of my long-term vision for safe and robust AI systems, including learning from multi-modal human input, interpretable and verifiable robustness, and developing techniques for human-in-the-loop robust machine learning that generalize beyond reward function uncertainty.\"",

We describe the processing elements and their SIMD spatial microarchitecture capable of efficiently exploiting dataflow locality in deep learning models. Starting with over 400,000 arithmetic units, we describe the stream programming model with each on-chip functional unit (eg. vector processor, matrix unit, etc) are consuming tensor inputs from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstreams\\xe2\\x80\\x9d flowing on the chip, and producing output tensors that can be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchained\\xe2\\x80\\x9d together to avoid writing intermediate results back to main memory. The combination of stream programming and dataflow locality along with deterministic execution provides the compiler with a simple abstraction of the underlying hardware components so that the compiler can orchestrate the arrival of input data (operands) with the instructions operating on them. We extend this simple \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeterministic execution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d model from a single chip to a distributed scale-out system that operates in lock-step across the entire distributed parallel computer, providing the illusion of a large single-core synchronous system. The Groq parallelizing compiler leverages this simple programming model to auto-scale the number of TSPs (processing elements) to grow with your deep learning models during the build-test-and-learn cycle to build robust numerical computations in production.\\\\n\\\\n* Oskar Mencer contributed to this presentation and was prepared to step in if Dennis Abts were to be indisposed and unable to give the talk.

Kennedy III, PE\\\\nPresident, Tennessee Valley Stellar Corporation\\\\n\\\\nMay 4, 2022\\\\n\\\\nGovernments worldwide have shown themselves incapable of working together to effectively deal with climate change. If we cannot kick our carbon habit as individuals and nation-states, then we can deploy a sunshade in space to cool the planet. Such shadecraft will have to be huge and will take decades to build. In order to have this contingency technology available by mid-century, we can buy a long-term option by starting technology development now.\\\\n \\\\nI was the lead author of a 2013 article on the design and construction of a large shadecraft called the Dyson Dot; it remains the leading authority in the field. In addition, I have been doing green energy for interesting people all around the world, helping scientists and engineers in emerging economies build stable teams to develop their own renewable resources. These experiences have led me to pursue this goal by starting with a prototype.\\\\n \\\\nWe have created Tennessee Valley Stellar Corporation, a non-profit entity, to cooperatively design and launch prototype shadecraft called Dyson picoDots. This project will operate at a stable, radiation-levitated orbit near the Sun-Earth Lagrange-1 point. The picoDots are based on cubesat technologies and are newly accessible to small organizations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRobert G. Kennedy III is a polyglot generalist systems engineer who does green energy for interesting people all over the world.  His experience ranges from the very smallest scales (e.g., nuclear engineering, transmutation of elements) thru meso- (climate change and of course green energy) to the largest (geoengineering, megastructures, interstellar exploration).  Many moons ago, he spent a year on Capitol Hill working for the Subcommittee on Space in the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was invited to lecture on geoengineering in Moscow at behest of Russian Academy of Sciences / Rosgidromet (weather service), to be submitted by them to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fifth Report.  In addition, he was formally invited by NASA twice (2013, 2015) to brief scientific staff at Marshall Spaceflight Center in Huntsville on space-based geoengineering, esp. solar radiation management (SRM).\\\\n\\\\n#climatechange #solar\"",

Such approaches can be used to validate robustness and safety of neural networks, but such exact verification is a hard combinatorial problem, and off-the-shelf solvers typically perform quite poorly.  Nonetheless, over the past several years there has been a large amount of progress in the area, and recent methods are able to verify medium-sized networks thousands of times faster than generic solvers.  In this talk, I will provide a general overview of the verification problem, then highlight several advances we and others have made in recent years to achieve these speedups.  Many of these approaches were implemented in our submission to the Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNNCOMP) in 2021, where our team, a collaboration with UCLA, Northeastern, and Columbia, won first place across most categories.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the speaker:  Zico Kolter is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department with the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

In this talk, I will explain three key challenges, and our recent research in overcoming them: \\\\n\\\\n1) ensuring robustness to environmental changes\\\\n2) anticipating and overcoming failures \\\\n3) efficiently adapting to user needs\\\\n\\\\nTo remain robust to environmental changes, we build probabilistic perception models to explicitly reason about object permanence and distributions of semantically meaningful movable objects. By anticipating and accounting for changes in the environment, we are able to robustly deploy robots in challenging frequently changing environments. To anticipate and overcome failures, we introduce introspective perception to learn to predict and overcome perception errors. Introspective perception allows a robot to autonomously learn to identify causes of perception failure, how to avoid them, and how to learn context-aware noise models to overcome such failures. To adapt and correct behaviors of robots based on user preferences, or to handle unforeseen circumstances, we leverage representation learning and program synthesis. We introduce visual representation learning for preference-aware planning to identify and reason about novel terrain types from unlabelled human demonstrations. We further introduce physics-informed program synthesis to synthesize and repair programmatic action selection policies (ASPs) in a human-interpretable domain-specific language with several orders of magnitude fewer demonstrations than necessary for neural network ASPs of comparable performance. The combination of these research advances allows us to deploy a varied fleet of wheeled and legged autonomous mobile robots on the campus scale at UT Austin, performing tasks that require robust mobility both indoors and outdoors.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program and courses: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\\\\n\\\\n#autonomousrobot\"",

This new wave of automation presents a new set of challenges compared to traditional automation tasks, e.g. in manufacturing. Manipulation workloads in the logistics industry involve extreme variability in the objects being handled: their shape, size, dynamics, condition, etc. as well as the sets of objects that must be managed and organized together. Additionally, these manipulators must be plugged into existing workflows and infrastructures that were designed for and still often interface with humans. Meeting this need, Dexterity is a robotics startup that has engineered and deployed robotic systems that can intelligently manipulate tens of thousands of items in production, reason about and operate in dynamic environments, collaborate with each other using the sense of touch, and safely operate in the presence of humans. Dexterity\\'s robots ship hundreds of thousands of units in packaged food and parcel warehouses each day and are in production 24/7. In this talk, we will describe the unique challenges we have encountered in bringing robot manipulation to logistics, including the technical advancements which we have employed to date, spanning engineering disciplines from machine learning, simulation, modeling, algorithms, and control, to robotic hardware \\\\u0026 software. We will describe the variety of automation workflows we are executing on which we have found provide the most value to our customers, including palletizing, depalletizing, kitting for fulfillment, and singulation for induction.

We\\'ve seen robots progress from the automation of repetitive tasks in manufacturing to the autonomy of mobilizing in unstructured environments to the cooperation of swarm robots that are centralized or decentralized. These abilities have required advances in robotic hardware, modeling, and artificial intelligence. The next frontier is robots collaborating in complex tasks with human teammates, in environments traditionally configured for humans. While solutions to this challenge must utilize all of the advances of robotics, the human element adds a unique aspect that must be addressed. Collaborating with a human teammate means that the robot must have a contextual understanding of the task as well as all participant\\'s roles. We will discuss what constitutes an effective teammate and how we can capture this behavior in a robotic collaborator. \\\\n\\\\nSee the playlist of Stanford Seminars here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about our Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\"",

Exploring the diverse scenarios of interaction between humans and robots in simulation can improve understanding of complex human-robot interaction systems and avoid potentially costly failures in real-world settings. In this talk, I propose formulating the problem of automatic scenario generation in human-robot interaction as a quality diversity problem, where the goal is not to find a single global optimum, but a diverse range of failure scenarios that explore both environments and human actions. I show how standard quality diversity algorithms can discover surprising and unexpected failure cases in the shared autonomy domain. I then discuss the development of a new class of quality diversity algorithms that significantly improve the search of the scenario space and the integration of these algorithms with generative models, which enables the generation of complex and realistic scenarios. Finally, I discuss applications in procedural content generation and human preference learning.\\\\n\\\\nView the Robotics Stanford Seminar Playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about our Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\"",

These categorizations, often delineated by cross-cutting axes or dimensions, support the combinatorial enumeration of and reasoning about design choices. I will present several design spaces that focus on visualization concerns. All of them have a common starting point, namely the qualitative approach of thematic analysis, but they diverge with respect to what type of source material was open-coded. In a literature study, we used the source material of analysis reports extracted from previously written papers on application-driven visualization work, called design studies in the visualization literature, to create a framework of high-level abstract analysis goals. In a technical observation study, we used the source material of software artifacts to create descriptive taxonomies of the data wrangling actions and processes of journalists, followed by reflective synthesis to create a design space for multi-table data wrangling. From a systematic survey of the figures in published papers from the genomic epidemiology literature, we derived a typology of how visualizations were created from a series of basic chart types, and how those charts were combined and enhanced. I will discuss the assessment of design spaces according to many criteria, including descriptive power, generative power, resonance, and parsimony.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist of Stanford Seminars here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about our Human-Computer Interaction Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-program\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:54 Design spaces: Continuing theme\\\\n1:53 Design spaces: What are they!\\\\n6:41 Design spaces: How to create!\\\\n10:51 Design space with three axes\\\\n11:51 Combinations: Characterize narrative, perceptual\\\\n12:45 Viable combinations\\\\n14:59 Assessment \\\\u0026 adoption descriptive power\\\\n19:25 Domain prevalence design space\\\\n20:44 By the numbers\\\\n22:17 Design space axis: Chart combinations of heterogeneous data\\\\n23:00 Design space axis: Enhancement choices, atop base chart types\\\\n27:20 Process overview\\\\n30:39 Key finding journalists use many, many tables\\\\n32:02 Multi-table data wrangling design space\\\\n32:23 Assessment: Cross-check\\\\n33:20 Task abstraction: Gap\\\\n35:36 Mapping terms\\\\n40:19 Summary: Multiple design spaces\\\\n44:47 Design spaces: How to assess?

Matrices and vectors allow researchers to succinctly communicate mathematical expressions involving arbitrary amounts of data. Mathematical notation using these constructs evolved over time to be readable and precise. Yet writing linear algebra with a computer is challenging: mathematicians must choose between writing in languages that produce well-formatted but semantically-underdefined representations such as LaTeX; or languages with well-defined semantics but notation unlike conventional math, such as C++/Eigen. In both cases, the underlying linear algebra is obfuscated by the requirements of esoteric language syntax (as in LaTeX) or awkward APIs due to language semantics (as in C++). The gap between representations results in communication challenges, including underspecified and irreproducible research results, difficulty teaching math concepts underlying complex numerical code, as well as repeated, redundant, and error-prone translations from communicated linear algebra to executable computer programs.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, Professor Gingold will describe I\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f LA, a language with syntax designed to closely mimic conventionally-written linear algebra, while still ensuring an unambiguous, compilable interpretation. Inspired by Markdown, a language for writing naturally-structured plain text files that translate into valid HTML, I\\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f LA allows users to write linear algebra in text form and compile the same source into LaTeX for scientific communication, C++/Eigen, Python/NumPy/SciPy, and MATLAB, with easy extension to further math programming environments.

Deprived of a sustainable business model by globalization, a sector built on mass production and high labor costs started 50 years of unrelenting, rapid decline. If we are to have a viable economy, a middle class, or continued coherent function as a nation, a sustainable and profitable model for production (probably more than one) is needed. Printing wasn\\'t reinvented by automating movable type. It took a systemic reimagining of personal computers, display technologies, interactive typesetting, word processing, printing, digital font design, and much more. E-commerce driven, on-demand, customizable products require a similarly broad reinvention, and are one of the most promising models for future manufacturing. But what does this look like in practice, and what role will be played by software and hardware automation?\\\\n\\\\n    Over the last seven years, Buttonsmith has built the supporting automation and software to manufacture on-demand customizable products cost effectively at scale. It starts with reimagining production processes and methods for sustained single-piece flow. We build parameterized product designs, proceeding through customization workflow, e-Commerce listing management at scale, order handling, software-driven digital production and order tracking, packaging, and fulfillment. Lacking exemplars, we set up a prototype manufacturing operation to validate and quantify the processes and software and their revenue impact. Today, we manufacture customizable products in 6 wall clock minutes and 3 labor minutes per unit, from scratch, at about 5.6 times conventional margins, in quantity one. We are making our first foray into robotics this year. Our prototype manufacturing group has allowed us to grow at 85%+ per year, organically, while incurring the cost of a software team, in an industry whose organic growth rate averages only 15% a year without the software team. In multiple product areas, we maintain the largest pool of active designs in the world, which would be impossible in a mass-production approach.

Despite these advances, researchers and practitioners are well-aware of the brittleness of existing perception systems, and a large gap still separates robot and human perception. This talk presents our latest results on the design of the next generation of robot perception systems and algorithms. The first part of the talk discusses spatial perception systems and motivates the need for high-level 3D scene understanding for robotics. I introduce early work on metric-semantic mapping (Kimera) and novel hierarchical representations for 3D scene understanding (3D Dynamic Scene Graphs). Then, I present recent results on the development of Hydra, the first real-time spatial perception system that builds 3D scene graphs of the environment in real-time and without human supervision. The second part of the talk focuses on perception algorithms and draws connections between robustness of robot perception and global optimization. I present an overview of our certifiable perception algorithms, a novel class of algorithms that is robust to extreme amounts of noise and outliers and affords performance guarantees.

Humans are visual creatures: we spend most of our day deriving meaning from what we see. The rich stimuli that we process within fractions of a second using vision becomes information which serves many purposes in everyday life, from mundane activities such as identifying whether an object is one we can lean onto when we need a pause, to complex intellectual tasks such as making sense of a large amounts of multivariate data. In this talk, I will present my reflections on why choosing appropriate visual representations in user interfaces is such an important design decision to guide and empower people, and how easy it is to underuse or misuse their power.

With the abundance of massive datasets in industry and science, analysts also need exploration systems that can process data quickly and efficiently, otherwise these systems will fail to keep pace with a user\\'s analytic flow. Addressing these challenges requires a deeper understanding of not only how system behavior influences user performance, but also how user behavior influences system performance.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I will first discuss how system performance impacts the way people visually explore large datasets, in particular how system latency encourages user exploration bias. Then I will discuss how we can counteract these effects using behavior-driven optimizations, such as by learning user exploration patterns automatically, and exploiting these patterns to pre-fetch data ahead of users as they explore to reduce system latency. Then I will discuss how I synthesize evaluation methodology from HCI, visualization, and data management into executable benchmarks for testing database management systems under real-time interactive analysis scenarios. Finally, I will discuss my ongoing research to further characterize, optimize, and evaluate interactive data exploration systems to promote more reliable, rigorous, and engaging analyses.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

For now, there\\'s still a big gap between the programming skills of occasional programmers - social scientists, journalists, data scientists - and the skills required to write the programs they want. However, the need is pressing; while there are about 20 million programmers in the world, there are now at least twice as many end users writing code to work with data. In this talk, I\\'ll describe Helena, an ecosystem of programming languages and programming tools that I have used to study how we can support social scientists programming needs. Non-programmers use Helena to collect datasets from the web and, more broadly, to develop custom web automation programs. It brings together the following key innovations: (i) The Helena programming environment uses Programming by Demonstration (PBD); it takes a single-shot learning approach, synthesizing scripts based on recording a single user demonstration. (ii) Helena\\'s adaptive replayer makes scripts robust to webpage redesigns and obfuscation, which enables longitudinal experiments. (iii) With novel language constructs, non-coders can conduct programming tasks usually limited to expert programmers - e.g., failure recovery, parallelization.\\\\n\\\\nBuilding Helena demanded novel insights into the web automation domain, but it also required a new design approach, a tightly coupled union of techniques from Programming Languages (PL) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I\\'ll connect this work to a discussion about how my lab is bringing together techniques from PL and HCI and why the PL-HCI combination is so powerful for democratizing computation.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\n\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist of Stanford Seminars here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n#datascience \\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n1:17 Bridge the gap\\\\n2:15 My background\\\\n2:47 Agenda\\\\n3:19 Framing\\\\n8:28 Program Synthesis\\\\n9:03 Pop quiz\\\\n9:36 Pop quiz 2\\\\n10:42 How to get to a better position\\\\n11:42 What we will talk about\\\\n12:03 How many people ave written a web scraper\\\\n13:09 Housing voucher programs\\\\n14:45 End user web automation\\\\n15:52 Web automation programming\\\\n16:43 Why is this so hard\\\\n22:01 Web automation demo\"",

However, training reinforcement learning agents is a tedious, human-in-the-loop process, requiring heavy engineering and often resulting in suboptimal results. In this talk we explore two main directions toward scalable reinforcement learning. First, we discuss several methods for zero-shot sim2real transfer for mobile and aerial navigation, including visual navigation and fully autonomous navigation on a severely resource constrained nano UAV. Second, we observe that the interaction between the human engineer and the agent under training as a decision-making process that the human agent performs, and consequently automate the training by learning a decision making policy. With that insight, we focus on zero-shot generalization and discuss learning RL loss functions and a compositional task curriculum that generalize to unseen tasks of evolving complexity. We show that across different applications, learning-to-learn methods improve reinforcement learning agents generalization and performance, and raise questions about nurture vs nature in training autonomous systems.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n3:54 How to train goal reaching policies?\\\\n17:46 What about resource-constrained robots?\\\\n28:13 Training RL Agents is a (Sequential) Decision Making Problem\\\\n29:45 Learning Loss Functions\\\\n29:51 Evolving RL Algorithms\\\\n36:06 Generative Curriculum for Compositional Tasks\\\\n36:36 Autonomous web navigation\\\\n39:37 Learning to Navigate Web\\\\n43:19 Compositional Design of Environments (CODE)\\\\n46:58 Does it work in reality?

However, if robots are to truly work alongside humans in the wild, they need to solve fundamental challenges that go beyond collecting large-scale datasets. Robots must continually improve and learn online to adapt to individual human preferences. How do we design robots that both understand and learn from natural human interactions? In this talk, I will dive into two core challenges. First, I will discuss learning from natural human interactions where we look at the recurring problem of feedback-driven covariate shift. We will tackle this problem from a unified framework of distribution matching. Second, I will discuss learning to predict human intent where we look at the chicken-or-egg problem of planning with learned forecasts. I will present a graph neural network approach that tractably reasons over latent intents of multiple actors in the scene. Finally, we will demonstrate how these methods come together to result in a self-driving product deployed at scale.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\n#robots\"",

Individual eye fixation patterns can hold clues to the intention and state of mind of the user; while pooling the eye movements of a group of individuals can reveal patterns in images and videos to help prioritize visual content for image processing and graphic design applications. I will motivate some of the automatic applications possible when computational models of visual attention are available. These include image and video cropping, as well as graphic design retargeting and reflow. At the heart of these applications and models are datasets of human visual attention patterns, many collected without explicit eye tracking, instead using a variety of crowdsourcing techniques.

Every device used at home and work will be included as well as all equipment used in recreation, entertainment, socializing, and relaxation including clothing, accessories and shoes.\\\\n\\\\nInformation will be integrated from massive pervasively inconsistent information from video, Web pages, hologlasses (electronic glasses with holographic-like overlays), online data bases, sensors, articles, human speech and gestures, etc. Information integration will enable an intelligent system to be used by other intelligent systems without having to start over from scratch. Information inference will be robust taking into account multiple sources and perspectives and counterbalancing many interests and perspectives. UIS will largely overcome the current reuse pain point that there is no effective inference for information that is balkanized in applications. An Intelligent System will be educable so that it can interactively adapt in real time (instead of relying exclusively on passively attempting to find correlations among inputs.\\\\n\\\\nAn Intelligent System will be self-informative in the sense of knowing its own goals, plans, history, provenance of its information. Also, it will have relevant information about its own capabilities including strengths and weaknesses. When overload or other internal trouble is inferred, an Intelligent System will be able to reach out as appropriate to people and other systems.\\\\n\\\\nSecurity will be paramount for an Intelligent System so that it is not easy to penetrate or to deceive into taking inappropriate action.\\\\n\\\\nProject Liftoff(TM) to develop and deploy UIS in this decade stands to be a huge development effort comparable to the Apollo Project. Education will be crucial to the success of Project Liftoff because there is an enormous talent shortage.\\\\n\\\\nDownload the full paper here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3428114\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist of Stanford Seminars here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

    "desc": "Amy Pavel\\\\nUniversity of Texas, Austin \\\\n\\\\nJanuary 7, 2022\\\\n\\\\nVideo is becoming a primary medium for communication across education, work, social media, and entertainment. While videos are engaging and informative, they lack the familiar and useful affordances of text for browsing, skimming, and consuming information. This severely limits who can interact with video content and how they can interact with it, and means that much of the information in videos is not accessible to everyone.\\\\n\\\\nBut, how can we make videos accessible for all users?\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I\\'ll share my work creating interactive Human-AI systems to improve the non-visual accessibility of videos during three key stages: (1) the planning and capture stage, (2) the post-production stage, and (3) the search and consumption stage. First, I\\'ll discuss core challenges of finding information in videos from interviews of people with domain expertise and/or visual impairments. Then, I will present new systems that leverage AI, and the results of technical and user evaluations that demonstrate system efficacy. I will conclude by discussing how hybrid HCI-AI work will make digital communication more effective and accessible in the future, and how new interactions can help us to realize the full potential of recent AI/ML advances.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

    "desc": "Jessica Hullman \\\\nNorthwestern University \\\\n\\\\nDecember 3, 2021 \\\\nResearch and development in computer science and statistics have produced increasingly sophisticated software interfaces for interactive and exploratory analysis, optimized for easy pattern finding and data exposure. But design philosophies that emphasize exploration over other phases of analysis risk confusing a need for flexibility with a conclusion that exploratory visual analysis is inherently model free and cannot be formalized. I will motivate how without a grounding in theories of human statistical inference, research in exploratory visual analysis can lead to contradictory interface objectives and representations of uncertainty that can discourage users from drawing valid inferences. I will discuss how the concept of a model check can help bridge traditionally exploratory and confirmatory activities, and suggest new directions for software and empirical research around exploratory and visual analysis, including how to facilitate external representation and exploration of candidate models during visual analysis. More broadly, I will motivate formalization of the role of graphics in statistical practice as a counterpoint to relying on intuition or brute force empiricism to guide research and practice.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n1:02 Visualizations help offload cognition to perception\\\\n2:13 State-of-the-art: Optimize for easy pattern finding\\\\n8:03 Approaches to visualize distribution or uncertainty\\\\n8:47 Error bars/intervals violate expressiveness\\\\n10:54 Probability encodings often hard to read accurately\\\\n11:59 Frequency based uncertainty visualization\\\\n16:21 Evaluation: Effect size judgments\\\\n17:43 Mean difference heuristic in effect size judgments\\\\n18:40 Sensitivity to visual distance between means\\\\n20:14 Investigating the mean difference heuristic\\\\n22:18 Uncertainty visualization conditions\\\\n27:12 Bayesian cognition to understand belief updating\\\\n30:40 How well do visualizations support causal inference?\\\\n33:04 How does visualization support learning in analysis?\\\\n33:29 Good visualizations facilitate model checks\\\\n35:32 Implicit model checks give graphs their meaning\\\\n37:03 Graphical inference as Bayesian model check\\\\n39:31 Tableau-like system supporting model checks\\\\n41:24 From visualization to implied model\\\\n44:51 Open questions\\\\n46:35 What characterizes good inference problems for vis?\\\\n48:08 Bounding the value of a more expressive visualization\\\\n\\\\n#inference\"",

I will focus particularly on our work with data scientists and mixed-ability programming teams.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

However, few of these innovations are centrally driven by questions of equity, diversity, or inclusion. In this talk I describe some of my on-going research to leverage multimodal technologies in ways that foster creativity among youth, support people with disabilities and allow researchers to better understand student learning in non-traditional learning environment. Ostensibly, I will highlight opportunities for multimodal technologies to simultaneously support researchers and end-users, while also proposing various ways that this work addresses important research questions.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

The ways we visualize data directly influence the conclusions we draw and decisions we make; however, our knowledge of how visualization design influences data analysis is largely grounded in heuristics and intuition. My research instead empirically models how people interpret visualized data to understand limitations in current visualization systems. We use these results to develop novel visualization systems that support accurate analysis of complex data and better scale to the needs of modern analytics challenges by incorporating interactive statistical analytics and immersive display technologies to increase the accessibility, scalability, and pervasiveness of data-driven reasoning. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts towards improving exploratory data analysis tools across a variety of domains, including self-advocacy and emergency response.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

In HCI, speculation is often framed as a tactic for expert designers from the global North to open new spaces for innovation. In this work, we ask how our understandings of speculation shift if we consider its progenitors to be those on the postcolonial periphery. Drawing on postcolonial anthropology and research through design, we analyze two historical cases of technology-infused development projects in Jamaica and in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The political leadership of both these British ex-colonies invested heavily in state-sponsored projects that leveraged technological imaginaries to envision modern futures as developed states. These imaginaries were bold, risky, and never realized. Viewing these projects as forms of vernacular speculative design, we find that speculation in these contexts is simultaneously constrained by, drawing on, and breaking out of imaginations of technological innovation arising from the global North. We will explore the implications of these perspectives for using speculation for the benefit of historically marginalized Black communities in the US.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

Having these mathematical structures precisely defined can make systems more secure because there are fewer ambiguities and holes for cyberattackers to exploit. For example, there are no infinite elements in models for natural numbers to be exploited. On the other hand, the 1st-order theories and computational systems which are not strongly-typed necessarily provide opportunities for cyberattack.\\\\n\\\\nCyberattackers have severely damaged national, corporate, and individual security as well causing hundreds of billions of dollars of economic damage. A significant cause of the damage is that current engineering practices are not sufficiently grounded in theoretical principles. In the last two decades, little new theoretical work has been done that practically impacts large engineering projects with the result that computer systems engineering education is insufficient in providing theoretical grounding. If the current cybersecurity situation is not quickly remedied, it will soon become much worse because of the projected development of Scalable Intelligent Systems by 2025.\\\\n\\\\nKurt G\\xc3\\xb6del strongly advocated that the Turing Machine is the preeminent universal model of computation. A Turing machine formalizes an algorithm in which computation proceeds without external interaction. However, computing is now highly interactive, which this article proves is beyond the capability of a Turing Machine. Instead of the Turing Machine model, this article presents an axiomatization of a strongly-typed universal model of digital computation (including implementation of Scalable Intelligent Systems) up to a unique isomorphism. Strongly-typed Actors provide the foundation for tremendous improvements in cyber defense.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

Then, the efficient and non-redundant full-batch GNN can be applied over the sampled subgraph. An example of this method is Cluster-GCN. Cluster-GCN first pre-processes a large graph by partitioning it into clusters of nodes.

Therefore, to generate embeddings of nodes in the mini-batch, only the K-hop neighborhood nodes and their features are needed to load onto a GPU, a tractable operation even if the original graph is large.

By removing the nonlinearity, a GCN is reduced to a simple feature pre-processing model, which is extremely efficient and scales well to a large graph. However, the model\\'s expressiveness might be limited due to this simplification. Surprisingly, the simplified GCN model often works well on practical node classification benchmarks. This is because these benchmark graphs often exhibit homophily structure (nodes with the same target labels tend to be connected), and the simplified GCN naturally makes such predictions for nodes in a graph.\\\\n \\\\nTo follow along with the course schedule and syllabus, visit: \\\\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/\\\\n\\\\n#machinelearning #machinelearningcourse\"",

We will first discuss the limitations of the Graph Neural Networks that we have introduced so far. We summarize 2 main imperfections of existing GNNs. First, existing GNNs will always fail on certain position-aware tasks, where we want to embed nodes based on their positions in the graph rather than their neighborhood structure; the solution we will introduce is Position-aware Graph Neural Networks. Second, the message passing GNNs we have introduced have expressive power upper bounded by the WL test; we will discuss how to overcome this limitation by introducing Identity-aware Graph Neural Networks.\\\\n \\\\nTo follow along with the course schedule and syllabus, visit: \\\\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/\\\\n\\\\n#machinelearning #machinelearningcourse\"",

We first summarize the failure cases of existing GNNs in node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the idea of inductive node coloring, where we assign different colors to the node we want to embed vs. the rest of the nodes. We argue that the inductive node coloring can help us overcome the limitations of existing GNNs. Moreover, ID-GNNs utilize this node coloring via a simple version of heterogenous message passing. In summary, ID-GNN presents a general and powerful extension to the GNN framework and is the first message passing GNN that is more expressive than 1-WL test.

To start, we define position-aware tasks, where we would like to classify nodes based on their positions in the graph. We demonstrate that certain position-aware tasks will always cause GNNs to fail. Our solution is the Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNN). The key idea of P-GNN is to introduce randomly selected anchors node, where we will embed all the nodes by computing their shortest path distances to these anchor nodes.

The idea of GCPN is to generative desirable graphs via reinforcement learning, where the reward is defined by the goal of graph generation, and the policy network is parametrized as a Graph Neural Network (GNN). We compare the differences between GCPN and GraphRNN. GCPN is able to generate molecules with high drug-likeness score, which reveals a new direction for in-silico drug discovery.

The idea of GraphRNN is to generate graphs via sequentially adding nodes and edges. This graph generation process can be modeled in 2 levels: (1) node-level, where each node is added at a time; (2) edge-level, where edges are added between a new node and the existing nodes. We model these 2 processes via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

In principle, a newly added node could potentially connect with any prior node. GraphRNN solves this issue via enforcing a Bread-first-search (BFS) node ordering for any given graph. Through the BFS ordering, we can reduce the possible node orderings from O(n!) to the number of distinct BFS orderings; additionally, a BFS ordering greatly reduces the steps for edge generation, since it limits the number of considered previous nodes to the nodes in the BFS frontier.\\\\n\\\\nAnother core topic is how to properly evaluate a generative model for graphs. As an intuitive metric, one can visually examine the similarity of graphs. GraphRNN proposes a more rigorous approach, where we wish to compare the set of graph statistics between the synthetic graphs and the ground-truth graphs. Here, we will first use Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to compute similarity between 2 graph statistic distributions; then, we will use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the similarity between 2 sets of graph statistics.

While the sociotechnical systems deploying these algorithms--search engines, social networking sites, and others--have the potential to dramatically improve human life, they also run the risk of reproducing or intensifying social inequities and tensions. In my research, I ask whether and how these systems are biased and how those biases impact users, towards the aim of building better sociotechnical systems.\\\\n\\\\nUnderstanding sociotechnical systems and their effects requires a combination of computational and social techniques. In this talk, I will describe my work conducting algorithm audits and randomized controlled user experiments to study representation and bias. For example, by auditing gender and race in image search results for common U.S. occupations and comparing to baselines in the U.S. workforce we find that marginalized people are underrepresented relative to their workforce participation rates. When measuring people\\'s responses to synthetic search results in which the gender and racial composition are manipulated, however, we see that the effect of diverse image search results is complex and mediated by the user\\'s own identity. I will also touch on extensions of this strategy in other domains, such as my algorithm audit of partisan political media in web search results, and my most recent work building tools to make such work more accessible and sustainable for researchers.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n#bias\"",

This algorithm is widely applicable and can be used with weighted graphs and for finding heirarchable communities. You will see Louvain algorithm works greedily to maximize modularity operating in two phases. In phase I, local changes can be made to node-community memberships. And in phase II, identified communities are aggregated into super-nodes to form a new network. We see how this process can be repeated to convergence to get the final communities.\\\\n \\\\nTo follow along with the course schedule and syllabus, visit: \\\\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/\\\\n\\\\n#machinelearning #machinelearningcourse\"",

Through this discussion, we highlight the unique nature of graphs - unlike many traditional data types (e.g. images), in graphs, individual data examples (e.g. nodes) are not necessarily independent; therefore, special attention must be places when splitting graph data, as the test set is not guaranteed to be fully held out. In this lecture, we present two different dataset settings: 1) transductive, where the dataset consists of a single graph that is fully observed and 2) inductive, where the dataset consists of multiple graphs and we look to generalize to unseen graphs. For each setting, we discuss applications to node, edge, and graph level tasks completing our overview of the GNN training pipeline. \\\\n \\\\nTo follow along with the course schedule and syllabus, visit: \\\\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/\"",

For graph feature augmentation, we discuss methods for injecting additional node feature information into the graph.

We learn 2 lessons from the problem of over-smoothing: (1) We should be cautious when adding GNN layers; (2) we can add skip connections in GNNs to alleviate the over-smoothing problem. When the number of GNN layers is small, we can enhance the expressiveness of GNN by creating multi-layer message / aggregation computation, or adding pre-processing / post-processing layers in the GNN. \\\\n\\\\nTo follow along with the course schedule and syllabus, visit: \\\\nhttp://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/\"",

A general GNN layer consists of 2 main components: (1) message computation, (2) Aggregation. In a GNN layer, each node will first create a message based on the message computation, then the messages will be sent to its neighboring node, finally each node will aggregate the messages from its neighbors based on the aggregation function. Based on this idea, we discuss how GCN, GraphSAGE and GAT layers can be represented as message computation + aggregation in detail.

This literature often characterizes view-based social media practices as passive use, contrasting it with more desirable, interactive active use such as clicking. However, we lack deep understanding of how users experience viewing and clicking practices and the empirical relationship between them. In this talk I will highlight findings from a study that employed a combination of eye tracking, survey, and interview methods (N=42) to investigate the non-click - instances where people intentionally and thoughtfully withhold from clicking on content they spend time viewing.

    "desc": "Designing for Voice: Access, Autonomy, and Justification Questions in Designing Computing Technologies with Marginalized Communities\\\\n\\\\nIshtiaque Ahmed\\\\nUniversity of Toronto\\\\n\\\\nMarch 19, 2021\\\\nThe benefits of computing are often confined within the populations with certain privileges. Those benefits rarely reach billions of underprivileged lives around the world fighting extreme poverty, illiteracy, gender discrimination, forced migration, and various other exploitations and marginalization. The services that are available through computing often fail to address their needs and constraints. My research with various marginalized communities in the Indian subcontinent over the last twelve years has revealed how this failure is often associated with some of the core issues of computing, including access, autonomy, and justification. In this talk, I will explain these three topics by describing three projects that I have been working on, each of which involves ethnography and design work with marginalized communities in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Canada. My talk will focus on how access to computing becomes limited by the imposition of colonial perspectives, how autonomy over a digital platform is curtailed by discriminatory standards, and how computing technologies often silence local voices by using western scientific rationalities. In this talk, I will further demonstrate how my design research explores possible ways to strengthen the voice of marginalized communities by focusing on local values, participation, and pluralism.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

    "desc": "Sherry Ruan\\\\nStanford University\\\\n\\\\nIn the well-known two sigma problem introduced in 1984, Bloom found that students tutored by a one-on-one expert tutor achieved a learning outcome two standard deviations higher than those taught using traditional classroom methods. Since one-on-one tutoring is too costly to scale up to the majority of students, technology-based solutions have been suggested as promising solutions to simulate one-on-one human tutoring experiences. However, current automated computer-based tutors still primarily consist of learning activities with limited interactivity such as multiple-choice questions, review-and-flip flash cards, and listen-and-repeat practices. These tutors tend to be unengaging and thus their effectiveness typically relies on students\\' desire to learn. With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), we now have the potential to create conversation-based tutoring systems with the ability to provide personalized feedback to make learning more engaging and effective and eventually help bridge the gap between one-on-one human tutoring and computer-based tutoring.\\\\n\\\\nIn this dissertation, I present the design, development, and testing of four AI-based conversational tutoring systems that personalize learning for adults and children. For adult learning, I present two systems: QuizBot for helping college students learn factual knowledge and EnglishBot for tutoring second language learners in speaking English. For child learning, I present two systems embedding conversational tutors into narrative stories to supplement elementary school students\\' math learning: the first implemented using Wizard-of-Oz techniques and the second powered by online reinforcement learning algorithms. I conducted human evaluations with over 500 students using these tutoring systems to better understand how humans interact with AI in these educational systems. Our results show that, compared to current learning systems, conversation-based tutoring systems that leverage new natural language processing and reinforcement learning techniques to provide adaptive feedback can engage students more, motivate them to spend more time using tutoring systems, and improve student learning outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\\"",

To ensure that AI systems do more good than harm, it is critical that they are designed to bring out the best of human ability while also helping to overcome human limitations. In some cases, AI has the potential to help humans scale the delivery of services, make more equitable decisions, and free up human time for more meaningful activities. Yet if not carefully designed, AI systems risk rigidly scaling practices without sensitivity to local context, propagating harmful inequities, or automating away valuable human-human interactions.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, Ken will share work towards the design of systems that combine complementary strengths of human and AI decision-making, across two main research strands: 1) co-designing effective human-AI partnerships for K-12 education and 2) supporting fairer decision-making in human-AI systems. As a case study, Ken will first discuss insights from the co-design, development, and field evaluation of Lumilo, a form of real-time, wearable augmentation for K-12 teachers who work with AI tutors in the classroom. Then, Ken will share research exploring commercial product teams\\' challenges and needs for support in developing fairer AI systems. Finally, Ken will discuss some ongoing research directions within my group, exploring core challenges in designing for human-AI complementarity.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

But, this powerful technology also comes with a unique set of ethical and safety challenges. So, how can AI be integrated into healthcare in a way that maximizes its potential while also protecting patient safety and privacy? \\\\n\\\\nIn this session faculty from the Stanford AI in Healthcare specialization discuss the challenges and opportunities involved in bringing AI into the clinic, safely and ethically, as well as its impact on the doctor-patient relationship. They also outline a framework for analyzing the utility of machine learning models in healthcare and will describe how the US healthcare system impacts strategies for acquiring data to power machine learning algorithms.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about the  Stanford AI in Healthcare: https://learn.stanford.edu/bringing-ai-into-healthcare-webinar.html?utm_source=youtube\\\\u0026utm_medium=social\\\\u0026utm_campaign=webinar\\\\n\\\\nSpeakers:\\\\nLaurence Baker\\\\nTina Hernandez-Boussard\\\\nMatthew Lungren\\\\nNigam Shah\\\\nSerena Yeung\\\\n\\\\n#ai #healthcare\"",

These technologies often act as guides that tell VIPs what to do, but our goal should be to give VIPs the ability to make decisions themselves. In this talk, I will show how to design assistive technologies to foster agency rather than merely acting as a guide.

We\\'ve seen robots progress from the automation of repetitive tasks in manufacturing to the autonomy of mobilizing in unstructured environments to the cooperation of swarm robots that are centralized or decentralized. These abilities have required advances in robotic hardware, modeling, and artificial intelligence. The next frontier is robots collaborating in complex tasks with human teammates, in environments traditionally configured for humans. While solutions to this challenge must utilize all of the advances of robotics, the human element adds a unique aspect that must be addressed. Collaborating with a human teammate means that the robot must have a contextual understanding of the task as well as all participant\\'s roles. We will discuss what constitutes an effective teammate and how we can capture this behavior in a robotic collaborator.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:22 Assistive Robotics and Manipulation Laboratory ARM\\\\n1:49 Evolution Towards Collaborative Robotics\\\\n2:46 What Does Effective Human-Robot Collaboration Look Like\\\\n3:51 Open Questions?\\\\n4:12 Robot-Robot Collaboration\\\\n5:31 Coordination in Humans and in Nature\\\\n8:00 Key Features of Teamwork\\\\n9:05 What are the natural limitations of Biological team\\\\n9:53 Robotic Tools\\\\n10:15 Proprioception and Control\\\\n14:08 Perception - Tactile Sensors\\\\n18:52 Intelligence\\\\n20:07 Robotic Consensus and Swarm Behavior\\\\n20:59 Considerations for Human-Robot Teams\\\\n21:24 Types of Human-Robot Collaboration\\\\n21:56 Wearables - Ability Substituting Device\\\\n33:13 Wearables - Ability Enhancing Device\\\\n38:19 External Robotic Collaborator\\\\n44:46 Takeaways\"",

However, with the rise of online fake news, misinformation, and political extremism, it is becoming increasingly difficult to have civil conversations on the internet. As a first step to addressing this issue, scholars need to understand how the current design of online environments shapes the ability of people to respectfully engage across social and political differences. In this talk, I call upon two projects to demonstrate how common online design features and practices (such as the use of hashtags and unfiltered comments) directly impact the quality of democratic discourse at-scale. Using natural language processing, statistics, and experimental design, I find that the political reputation of a news platform and the presence of political hashtags in online news articles both affect the quality of discussion on race and gender equality topics. Collectively, these projects are motivated to understand how online spaces can be better designed to foster interaction and discourse that can bridge rather than sharpen social differences.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

For example, wheelchair users often use and carry multiple mobile computing devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Upper body motor impairments or physically restrictive wheelchair frames may limit wheelchair users\\xc2\\x92 ability to interact with these devices. Designing technology for wheelchair users requires constant negotiation between the user\\xc2\\x92s needs, technological and functional constraints, and the context in which the technology is used. My research aims to support a broad range of people with diverse abilities as they interact with the world and people around them.

However, few have access to in-person classes to help improve upon their artistic skills. Inspired by critique sessions common in these art practice classes, my research proposes new camera interfaces that provide contextual feedback to aid users in learning elements of photography. We provide this feedback as additional information for the user at capture-time through interactively visualizing results of image processing algorithms. In designing these interfaces, we aim to provide feedback that allows users to maintain creative freedom while producing photos that they believe are higher quality.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tutorials/cheat-sheet-pro-portrait-lighting-setups\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

In this talk, I will share several studies within a project that exemplify the methods I use for gathering personal narratives of marginalization and for developing and evaluating empowering games and social technologies. The CARE (coping after racist experiences) project uses interactive narratives to study how people experience, cope with, and seek support for interpersonal racism such as racist microaggressions. I will share qualitative interviews, user testing, and participatory design work that brings people from marginalized backgrounds to the table in designing for a more empowered future.

Makers have adopted agile methodologies that measure product readiness by a narrow set of criteria. And global markets reward digital-first businesses the attract a large customer base in a short time. In this culture and environment, sometimes products and services are launched without considering how they will be governed and whether they are safe for widespread use by consumers or society.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, Lisa Welchman defines and discusses the role of digital safety. She references and draws comparisons to historical consumer safety practices-- those that have been self-imposed by makers and those imposed by governments and society. She will talk about the structure and nature of development teams and how to ensure that founders and executives play their part in ensuring the products they develop and promote are fit for use and safe. She will conclude by examining the impact and efficacy of applying safety checks during each digital product development process phase.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate \\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

The open research problems of computing with FPGAs arc: (1) understanding the limitations of FPGAs when competing with microprocessors, and (2) providing a useful programming methodology.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I will show how FPGAs can be utilized to accelerate certain algorithms by up to three orders of magnitude. Examples for methods achieving the speedups arc:\\\\na. exploring parallelism and pipelining on the bit-level\\\\nb. optimizing the encoding of data values (number representation)\\\\nc. reducing the required memory bandwidth by implementing data-structures and algorithms directly on the FPGA\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, the speedup could be translated into savings in power consumption.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, I suggest a programming methodology for FPGAs based on Domain Specific Compilers. Domain specific compilers implement a divide-and-conquer, bottom-up approach to programming FPGAs. The vast space of possible architectures fragments into architecture families, which indirectly defines application domains. A domain specific compiler targets one architecture family and thus focuses on a single application domain. The StReAm compiler, under development at Bell Labs and Imperial College targets pipelined data-flow graphs mapped directly from object-oriented C++ to hardware. The goal is to provide a simple abstraction for programming FPGAs analogous to the abstraction of a microprocessor provided by the C programming language.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:33 Why Compute with FPGAS\\\\n3:55 A Programmer\\'s Technology Perspective\\\\n5:24 Generic System Architecture\\\\n6:43 Performance of FPGAS Examples\\\\n11:06 Boolean Satisfiability\\\\n12:32 BSAT FPGA versus Microprocessor\\\\n14:13 Content Addressable Memory (CAM)\\\\n15:47 Memory-like Computation Example: Dynamic Graph Accelerator based on the Adjacency Matrix\\\\n18:11 FPGAs versus DSP Processor International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)\\\\n19:01 Stream Architecture Mapping a dataflow graph directly to the hardware\\\\n20:02 Why Stream architectures save power\\\\n20:51 Classification into Application Domains\\\\n22:18 The VLSI CAD Productivity Gap\\\\n23:05 Programming FPGAS #VLSI Synthesis\\\\n26:30 The FPGA Programmers Task\\\\n31:28 Adding Levels of Abstraction\\\\n35:16 IDEA - Encryption\\\\n37:10 What if there is a loop?\\\\n38:20 Arithmetic for FPGAS\\\\n39:18 Number Representation\\\\n40:15 Precision / Range Optimization\\\\n41:41 Arithmetic Styles\\\\n41:59 Compound Arithmetic Example: Elementary Functions- undC math\\\\n42:53 thoughts on syntax and semantics for programming FPGAS Syntax\\\\n46:46 Conclusions\\\\n\\\\n#FPGAs\"",

This talk presents Almond as an open-source alternative.\\\\n\\\\nWe introduce a more cost-effective and robust methodology and tool set for building virtual assistants. We use an end-to-end neural model that translates natural language to directly executable code in our new virtual assistant programming language, called ThingTalk. As annotating real data training is prohibitively expensive, we train our neural network with mostly data synthesized with our Genie data engineering tool. Genie can automatically generate a dialogue agent from a database in given domains. In addition, it is designed to be extensible: developers can supply new domain schemas and APIs, domain-independent sentence templates and dialogue state machines in any language, as well as new ThingTalk constructs. Using this methodology, Almond has been shown to answer complex questions more accurately than existing commercial assistants in the domain of restaurant reservations.\\\\n\\\\nTo protect privacy, our Almond virtual assistant prototype has a federated design that lets users own their data and share their digital assets with full control. Almond has been integrated into Home Assistant, an open-source local gateway that can connect to hundreds of different IoT devices. By making all the tools, neural models, training data open-source, we wish to support open-world collaboration to create the smartest and open virtual assistant. Almond and more information are available on http://oval.cs.stanford.edu.\\\\n\\\\nThis research is supported by the NSF under grant No. 1900638.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n3:08 Consumer Privacy\\\\n8:09 Virtual Assistant Oligopoly\\\\n10:08 Threats of Virtual Assistants\\\\n11:59 Technical Barrier to Entry\\\\n15:53 Scaling to the Future of Virtual Assistants\\\\n18:38 This Talk\\\\n21:13 Alexa: Syntax-Dependent Representation\\\\n23:14 Alexa\\'s 2-Step Approach\\\\n23:41 Idea 1: End-to-End Translation\\\\n27:53 Unique Semantic Representation\\\\n29:15 Idea 2: Training-Data Engineering\\\\n31:23 Genie: Synthesizes question/code from a schema\\\\n33:44 Semantic Parser Generation Thingpedia\\\\n37:28 Query Comparison - 4 Platforms\\\\n38:37 Comparison of 415 Restaurant Questions\\\\n40:18 Today\\'s Dialogue Trees: Laborious \\\\u0026 Brittle\\\\n42:59 Annotate 1 Dialogue at a Time\\\\n44:30 Genie: Transactional Dialogues State Machine\\\\n45:58 Modular, Reusable Technical Stack\\\\n48:47 Contextual Language Understanding Neural Model\\\\n50:19 Preliminary Results\\\\n51:04 Zero-Shot Learning Result\\\\n52:56 Three Research Results\\\\n53:13 Protect Privacy with an Open Federated Architecture\\\\n56:33 Example: Asthma Patient\\\\n\\\\n#monicalam #stanford #virtualassistant #privacy\"",

Thayer\\\\nSLAC, Stanford University\\\\n\\\\nMarch 4, 2020\\\\nThe increase in velocity, volume, and complexity of the data generated by the upcoming Linac Coherent Light Source upgrade (LCLS-II) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory presents a considerable challenge for data acquisition, data processing, and data management. These systems face formidable challenges due to the extremely high data throughput, hundreds of GB/s to multi-TB/s, generated by the detectors at the experimental facilities and to the intensive computational demand for data processing and scientific interpretation. The LCLS-II Data System is a fast, powerful, and flexible architecture that includes a feature extraction layer designed to reduce the data volumes by at least one order of magnitude while preserving the science content of the data. Innovative architectures are required to implement this reduction with a configurable approach that can adapt to the multiple science areas served by LCLS. In order to increase the likelihood of experiment success and improve the quality of recorded data, a real-time analysis framework provides visualization and graphically-configurable analysis of a selectable subset of the data on the timescale of seconds. A fast feedback layer offers dedicated processing resources to the running experiment in order to provide experimenters feedback about the quality of acquired data within minutes. We will present an overview of the LCLS-II Data System architecture with an emphasis on the Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) and online monitoring framework.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

This progress has turned applications such as autonomous driving and delivery tasks in warehouses, hospitals, or hotels into realistic application scenarios. However, robust manipulation in complex settings is still an open research problem. Various research efforts show promising results on individual pieces of the manipulation puzzle, including manipulator control, touch sensing, object pose detection, task and motion planning, and object pickup. In this talk, I will present our recent work in integrating such components into a complete manipulation system. Specifically, I will describe a mobile robot manipulator that moves through a kitchen, can open and close cabinet doors and drawers, detect and pickup objects, and move these objects to desired locations. Our baseline system is designed to be applicable in a wide variety of environments, only relying on 3D articulated models of the kitchen and the relevant objects. I will discuss the design choices behind our approach, the lessons we learned so far, and various research directions toward enabling more robust and general manipulation systems.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about our Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\"",

It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: a new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors; a GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python; an optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code; a novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training; a new data block API; and much more. We have used this library to successfully create a complete deep learning course, which we were able to write more quickly than using previous approaches, and the code was more clear. The library is already in wide use in research, industry, and teaching.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\\\\n\\\\n#deeplearning\"",

With the goal of ultimately achieving these capabilities on robotic systems, this talk will present a unified nonlinear control framework for realizing dynamic behaviors in an efficient, provably stable (via control Lyapunov functions) and safety-critical fashion (as guaranteed by control barrier functions). The application of these ideas will be demonstrated experimentally on a wide variety of robotic systems, including multi-robot systems with guaranteed safe behavior, bipedal and humanoid robots capable of achieving dynamic walking and running behaviors that display the hallmarks of natural human locomotion, and robotic assistive devices (including prostheses and exoskeletons) aimed at restoring mobility. The ideas presented will be framed in the broader context of seeking autonomy on robotic systems with the goal of getting robots into the real-world.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\"",

KUtrace is such a tool, based on small Linux kernel patches recording and timestamping every transition between kernel- and user-mode execution across all CPUs of a datacenter or vehicle computer. The resulting displays show exactly what each transaction is doing every nanosecond, and hence shows why unpredictable ones are slow, all with tracing overhead well under 1%. Recent additions to KUtrace also show interference between programs and show profiles within long execution stretches that have no transitions.\\\\n\\\\nThe net result is deep insight into the dynamics of complex software, leading to often-simple changes to improve performance.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

The problem of probabilistic state estimation via sensor measurements takes on a variety of forms, resulting in information about our own motion as well as the structure of the world around us. In this talk, I will discuss some approaches that my research group has been developing that focus on estimating these quantities online and in real-time in extreme environments where dust, fog and other visually obscuring phenomena are widely present and when sensor calibration is altered or degraded over time. These approaches include new techniques in computer vision, visual-inertial SLAM, geometric reconstruction, nonlinear optimization, and even some sensor development. The methods I discuss have an application-specific focus to ground vehicles in the subterranean environment, but are also currently deployed in the agriculture, search and rescue, and industrial human-robot collaboration contexts.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\"",

HCI, so far, has concentrated on designing interfaces primarily for people to monitor and control systems. The two fields HCI and Architecture - operate with different notions of what an interface is and what interaction means.\\\\nI begin with a quick look at the properties of interfaces and the concept of interaction those properties support. This shows that there are fundamental differences in the nature of interfaces and interaction found in three types of human-system engagement:\\\\nDirect manipulation, Network, and Architectural or ecological.\\\\nMy main point is that we need to adopt a niche notion of interaction where we are part of an ecology, not on the other side of an `interface\\' through which we interact. Ecological interaction is more complex, multi-relational and interesting. And niches cannot be defined independently of the agent or agents who inhabit the niche.\\\\nFor HCI and AI to reach its potential, it must be tune in to the social cognition of humans. It must be able to negotiate, share in situation awareness, participate in joint activity, feel or understand emotions, and understand enough about human experience to support positive experience. This is a different sort of interaction than HCI or AI historically has focused on.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu \\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n#hci\"",

    "desc": "Sandeep Chinchali\\\\nStanford University\\\\n\\\\nJanuary 10, 2020\\\\nToday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s robotic fleets are increasingly facing two coupled challenges. First, they are measuring growing volumes of high-bitrate video and LIDAR sensory streams, which, second, requires them to use increasingly compute-intensive models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), for downstream perception or control. To cope with such challenges, compute and storage-limited robots, such as low-power drones, can offload data to central servers (or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe cloud\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), for more accurate real-time perception as well as offline model learning. However, cloud processing of robotic sensory streams introduces acute systems bottlenecks ranging from network delay for real-time inference, to cloud storage, human annotation, and cloud-computing cost for offline model learning. In this talk, I will present learning-based approaches for robots to improve model performance with cloud offloading, but with minimal systems cost. For real-time inference, I will present a deep reinforcement learning based offloader that decides when a robot should exploit low-latency, on-board computation, or, when highly uncertain, query a more accurate cloud model. Then, for continual learning, I will present an intelligent, on-robot sampler that mines real-time sensory streams for valuable training examples to send to the cloud for model re-training. Using insights from months of field data and experiments on state-of-the-art embedded deep learning hardware, I will show how simple learning algorithms allow robots to significantly transcend their on-board sensing and control performance, but with limited communication cost.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:37 Robot sensory data + compute models are becoming increasingly complex\\\\n2:03 How Can Network Connectivity Help Robots?\\\\n4:43 Key Challenges of Cloud Robotics\\\\n6:01 1.

We used data collected from the YouTube website to analyze the balance in recommendation impressions to see if it is favoring more extreme content. 768 US political channels were categorized into culturally relevant orientations and sub-cultures and 23M recommendations for recent videos were recorded during November-December 2019. We found that the late 2019 recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from being presented with fringe content. The algorithm is shown to favor mainstream media and cable news content over independent YouTube channels with a slant towards partisan political channels like Fox News and Last Week Tonight.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

The focus of physical interaction is typically delegated to end-effectors, or hands, as these machines perform manual tasks. Despite decades of dedicated research, effective deployment of robot hands in the real world is still limited to a few examples, other than the use of rigid parallel-jaw grippers. In this presentation, I will review articulated hands that found application in the field, focusing primarily on ocean exploration and drawing examples from recent developments in the Embodied Dexterity Group. I will also introduce preliminary findings regarding an assistive mitten designed to improve the grasping strength of people with weakened hands.

    "desc": "Ricardo Sanfelice\\\\nUC Santa Cruz\\\\n\\\\nNovember 8, 2019\\\\nHybrid systems model the behavior of dynamical systems in which the states can evolve continuously and, at isolate time instances, exhibit instantaneous jumps. Such systems arise when control algorithms that involve digital devices are applied to continuous-time systems, or when the intrinsic dynamics of the system itself has such hybrid behavior, for example, in mechanical systems with impacts, switching electrical circuits, spiking neurons, atc. Hybrid control may be used for improved performance and robustness properties compared to conventional control, and hybrid dynamics may be unavoidable due to the interplay between digital and analog components in a cyber-physical system. In this talk, we will introduce analysis and design tools for model predictive control (MPC) schemes for hybrid systems. We will present recently developed results on asymptotically stabilizing MPC for hybrid systems based on control Lyapunov functions. After a short overview of the state of the art on hybrid MPC, and a brief introduction to a powerful hybrid systems framework, we will present key concepts and analysis tools. After that, we will lay out the theoretical foundations of a general MPC framework for hybrid systems, with guaranteed stability and feasibility. In particular, we will characterize invariance properties of the feasible set and the terminal constraint sets, continuity of the value function, and use these results to establish asymptotic stability of the hybrid closed-loop system. To conclude, we will illustrate the framework in several applications and summarize some of the open problems, in particular, those related to computational issues.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:45 Hybrid Predictive Control for Manipulation\\\\n8:54 Model Predictive Control (MPC) Predict system behavior, select best decision\\\\n17:39 Hybrid MPC in the Literature\\\\n19:26 Modeling Hybrid Behavior\\\\n36:36 Stability of Sample-and-Hold Control\\\\n39:16 Hybrid Basic Conditions (HBC)\\\\n40:27 Hybrid Equations (HyEQ) Toolbox The Hybrid Equations (HyEQ) Toolbox includes the following Simulink library for systems w/inputs and interconnections\\\\n40:55 Background on Model Predictive Control Most MPC strategies in the literature perform the following tasks Measure the current state of the system to control\\\\n46:35 Selecting the Prediction Horizon T\\\\n48:30 Example Implementation\\\\n50:18 Basic Conditions for Hybrid MPC\\\\n51:49 Stabilizing Ingredients for Hybrid MPC\\\\n55:09 MATLAB Implementation OPTI Toolbox\\\\n55:38 Hybrid Predictive Control for Tracking in Bipeds\\\\n56:25 Hybrid Predictive Control for Power Conversion\\\\n56:57 Hybrid Predictive Control for Motion Planning\\\\n57:18 Hybrid Predictive Control for Reactive Avoidance\"",

Theodore Markettos, Colin Rothwell, Brett F. Gutstein, Allison Pearce, Peter G. Neumann, Simon W. Moore, and Robert N. M. Watson, Thunderclap: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Operating-System IOMMU Protection via DMA from Untrustworthy Peripherals, Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS 2019), San Diego CA, 24-27 February 2019.\\\\nDirect Memory Access (DMA) attacks have been known for many years: DMA-enabled I/O peripherals have complete access to the state of a computer and can fully compromise it including reading and writing all of system memory. With the popularity of Thunderbolt 3 over USB Type-C and smart internal devices, opportunities for these attacks to be performed casually with only seconds of physical access to a computer have greatly broadened. In response, commodity hardware and operating-system (OS) vendors have incorporated support for Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs), which impose memory protection on DMA, and are widely believed to protect against DMA attacks. We investigate the state-of-the-art in IOMMU protection across OSes using a novel I/O-security research platform, and find that current protections fall short when faced with a functional network peripheral that uses its complex interactions with the OS for ill intent. We describe vulnerabilities in macOS, FreeBSD, and Linux, which notionally utilize IOMMUs to protect against DMA attackers. Windows uses the IOMMU only in limited cases. and it remains vulnerable. Using Thunderclap, an open-sourced FPGA research platform that we built, we explore new classes of OS vulnerability arising from inadequate use of the IOMMU. The complex vulnerability space for IOMMU-exposed shared memory available to DMA-enabled peripherals allows attackers to extract private data (sniffing cleartext VPN traffic) and hijack kernel control flow (launching a root shell) in seconds using devices such as USB-C projectors or power adapters. We have worked closely with OS vendors to remedy these vulnerability classes, and they have now shipped substantial feature improvements and mitigations as a result of our work. The paper and subsequent developments are at http://www.thunderclap.io.\\\\n\\\\nThe second part of this talk is a summary of the ongoing CHERI (Capability Hardware-Enhanced RISC Instructions) hardware-software developments, which began in 2010.

How trust is established online is therefore a key question for HCI to understand and address, especially as the landscape is rapidly changing with AI and algorithms increasingly mediating our online experiences. This talk will cover two different and critical aspects of online trust.\\\\n\\\\nIn the first part of the talk, I will present work on trust in the news media. Most people consume online news on platforms where algorithms present content from a mixed set of sources, for example news aggregators and news feeds. It is important, then, to evaluate the factors that contribute to how people evaluate the veracity of content in these environments. In this work, we follow on a body of research showing higher reported trust in politically aligned news sources. We investigate the determinants of the increased trust to distinguish between source evaluation and confirmation bias effects.\\\\n\\\\nIt is more than recommendations algorithms that mediate our online experiences. In the second part of the talk, I will outline a near-future where our personal communications are mediated by AI agents, or as we termed it: AI Mediated Communication (AI-MC). I will lay out the various ways in which AI-MC might impact our interpersonal communications, and describe a study where we examined the potential impact of AI-generated profile text on the perceived trustworthiness of Airbnb hosts.\\\\n\\\\nTaken together, the findings point to a bleak future of trust in our society, and offer a set of significant challenges for the future of HCI.\\\\n\\\\nThe studies I will present were led by PhD student Maurice Jakesch at Cornell, and are joint work with Jeff Hancock, Xiao Ma, and Karen Levy among others.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

Applications include transportation, energy, manufacturing and healthcare systems. Predictions of systems dynamics, human behavior and environment conditions can improve safety and performance of the resulting system. However, constraint satisfaction, performance guarantees and real-time computation are challenged by the growing complexity of the engineered system, the human/machine interaction and the uncertainty of the environment where the system operates. Our research over the past years has focused on predictive control design for autonomous systems performing iterative tasks. In this talk I will first provide an overview of the theory and tools that we have developed for the systematic design of learning predictive controllers. Then, I will focus on recent results on the use of data to efficiently formulate stochastic MPC problems which autonomously improve performance in iterative tasks. Throughout the talk I will focus on autonomous cars and solar power plants to motivate our research and show the benefits of the proposed techniques.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\\"",

Licensing models is a promising approach, but requires a robust tool for owners to claim ownership of models, i.e. a watermark. Unfortunately, current watermarks are all vulnerable to piracy attacks, where attackers embed forged watermarks into a model to dispute ownership. We believe properties of persistence and piracy resistance are critical to watermarks, but are fundamentally at odds with the current way models are trained and tuned.\\\\nIn this work, we propose two new training techniques (out-of-bound values and null-embedding) that provide persistence and limit the training of certain inputs into trained models. We then introduce wonder filters, a new primitive that embeds a persistent bit-sequence into a model, but only at initial training time. Wonder filters enable model owners to embed a bit-sequence generated from their private keys into a model at training time. Attackers cannot remove wonder filters via tuning, and cannot add their own filters to pretrained models. We provide analytical proofs of key properties, and experimentally validate them over a variety of tasks and models. Finally, we explore a number of adaptive counter-measures, and show our watermark remains robust.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu \\\\\"",

Nonetheless, recent progress in combining deep learning and geometry suggests that cameras may become a competitive source of reliable 3D information. In this talk, we will present our latest developments in self-supervised monocular depth and pose estimation for urban environments. Particularly, we show that with the proper network architecture, large-scale training, and computational power it is possible to outperform fully supervised methods while still operating on the much more challenging self-supervised setting, where the only source of input information are video sequences. Furthermore, we discuss how other sources of information (i.e. camera velocity, sparse LiDAR data, and semantic predictions) can be leveraged at training time to further improve pseudo-lidar accuracy and overcome some of the inherent limitations of self-supervised learning.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n2:46 Pseudo-LiDAR / Monocular Depth Estimation\\\\n6:00 Machine Learning at Scale: Beyond Supervised Learning\\\\n9:33 Self-Supervised Monocular Depth\\\\n10:36 Self-Supervised Depth Learning Objective\\\\n11:24 Photometric Loss ++\\\\n13:30 Depth Super-Resolution\\\\n14:26 Dense Monocular 3D Reconstruction\\\\n23:41 Packing/Unpacking blocks\\\\n27:09 Velocity Scaling\\\\n37:25 Two Stream Nets for Self-Supervised VO\\\\n39:55 Why Semi-Supervised?\\\\n40:32 Semi = Self + Reprojected(Fully)\\\\n44:21 Semi-Supervised PackNet\\\\n46:43 Semantically-Guided Depth Network\\\\n49:54 Class-Specific Depth Evaluation\\\\n50:21 Two-Stage Training for Infinite Depth\"",

While this opacity partly stems from protecting intellectual property and preventing malicious users from gaming the system, it is also designed to provide users with seamless, effortless system interactions. However, this opacity can result in misinformed behavior among users, particularly when there is no clear feedback mechanism for users to understand the effects of their own actions on an algorithmic system. The increasing prevalence and power of these opaque algorithms coupled with their sometimes biased and discriminatory decisions raise questions about how knowledgeable users are and should be about the existence, operation and possible impacts of these algorithms. In this talk, I will address these questions by exploring ways to investigate users\\' behavior around opaque algorithmic systems.

From autonomous driving and drone delivery to robotic devices in the home and workplace, robots are bound to play an increasingly central role in our everyday lives. However, the safe deployment of these systems in complex, human-populated spaces introduces new fundamental challenges. Whether safety-critical failures (e.g. collisions) can be avoided will depend not only on the decisions of the autonomous system, but also on the actions of human beings around it. Given the complexity of human behavior, how can robots reason through these interactions reliably enough to ensure safe operation in our homes and cities? In this talk I will present a vision for safe human-centered robotics that brings together control-theoretic safety analysis and Bayesian machine learning, enabling robots to actively monitor the \\xe2\\x80\\x9creality gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between their models and the world while leveraging existing structure to ensure safety in spite of this gap. In particular, I will focus on how robots can reason game-theoretically about the mutual influence between their decisions and those of humans over time, strategically steering interaction towards safe outcomes despite the inevitably limited accuracy of human behavioral models. I will show some experimental results on quadrotor navigation around human pedestrians and simulation studies on autonomous driving. I will end with a broader look at the pressing need for assurances in human-centered intelligent systems beyond robotics, and how control-theoretic safety analysis can be incorporated into modern artificial intelligence, enabling strong synergies between learning and safety.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about our Robotics and Autonomous Systems Graduate Program: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/robotics-and-autonomous-systems-graduate-program\"",

    "desc": "Oskar Mencer\\\\nMaxeler Technologies and Imperial College London\\\\n\\\\nSeptember 25, 2019\\\\nWe live in a world of seemingly increasing numbers of types of conflicts and less and less time and energy for each one. Chip Wars, Internet vs Democracy, and Flat Earthers,... At the same time, Technology reduces the information difference around the world, predicting what can be predicted, leaving the unpredictable as our future. Recently, as Enterprise Champion at Imperial College London, I started thinking more about the innovation challenge in a broader context. Each innovation addresses one or multiple pain points. Each time a possible solution to a pain point succeeds, there is a chance for a new pain point to arise from the new solution. The successful entrepreneur finds him or herself constantly chasing solutions to problems created by their success. I will complement the above journey with examples from building fast computers with FPGAs.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n4:41 Technology in banking - a problem in scale and complexity\\\\n9:48 Fastest computers for top 4 HPC applications\\\\n11:48 Commercializing FPGAs for Computation\\\\n16:31 Conflicts We live in a world of many conflicts\\\\n20:15 New Conflicts\\\\n24:15 The Kill Switch Product Idea\\\\n28:09 Uncertainty\\\\n30:34 The Homework Problem\\\\n32:58 Start a company, build a product Pain Points\\\\n35:18 Scaling is a race against cashflow\\\\n36:17 Top 10 Conflicts in Computing with FPGAS Conflict 1: HDL is hard, need a high level programming language Conflict 2: FPGAS DRAM Memory interfaces\\\\n39:57 HDL is hard, high level programming\\\\n40:30 C1: Connect language to space on the chip\\\\n43:33 FPGA floating point is inefficient (due to the barrel shifter)\\\\n45:02 Separating CPUs and FPGAS Conflict: CPU and FPGA in the same server is inefficient.

Superscalar out-of-order processor microarchitectures have been used successfully for hard processors for many years, but have so far been avoided for FPGAs due to the area increase and the expectation that a loss in clock frequency would more than offset the instructions-per-cycle (IPC) gains.\\\\n\\\\nThis talk summarizes my attempt at designing an out-of-order x86 CPU for FPGA. With careful microarchitectural choices and circuit design, I show that it is possible to build a complex microarchitecture on an FPGA, getting about 2.7x performance per clock and 0.8x clock frequency of Altera\\'s Nios II/f single-issue in-order processor.

However, existing productivity systems have tended to assume a one-size-fits all solution, whereas there are many factors - novelty effects, attrition, influences from other apps and devices, and differences in individual motivation - that we must take into account. In this thesis we present HabitLab, an in-the-wild experimentation platform we developed for conducting behavior change experiments, as well as a set of studies we run on the platform. HabitLab is a browser extension and android app with over 12,000 daily active, voluntary users, that users install to help them reduce time online and on their phones. It works by displaying one of 20+ interventions whenever they open an app or site they wish to spend less time on.\\\\n\\\\nWe use HabitLab as a large-scale experiment platform to understand behavior change. In our first set of studies, we investigate novelty effects of interventions, finding that compared to always showing the same intervention, a strategy of rotating between different interventions improves intervention effectiveness, but at the cost of increased attrition. This attrition is partly due to users being unfamiliar with rotating interventions, and improving users\\xc2\\x92 mental models with a notice shown whenever a new intervention is shown is able to reduce this attrition. In our second set of studies, we investigate whether reducing time on one site or app by intensifying interventions influences time on other sites, apps, and devices. We find that on the browser, reducing time on one site reduces time spent elsewhere, but we do not observe the effect on mobile devices, and do not observe cross-device effects. In our third set of studies, we investigate users\\xc2\\x92 motivation levels over time as indicated by the difficulty of interventions they select. We find that users initially overestimate how difficult of interventions they want, and their choices of difficulty progressively decline over time.\\\\n\\\\nDetails at https://habitlab.stanford.edu/\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

Importantly, the value may only be realizable through the integration of a number of dis-similar, separately-built, separately-owned, and separately-controlled sensing sub-systems. SMILE -- the Synchronized Multi-sensory Integrated Learning Environment -- is a CMU project that aims to create, deploy and validate a framework that addresses key challenges that arise in such a system-of-systems.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, we present early results of the SMILE project. We begin with an examination of some practical barriers in a typical smart city application. From this, we develop themes related to low-power operation, programmability, synchronization, federation, and the interplay between them. Within this context, we discuss four sub-projects: (1) a synchronization approach for low-power devices, (2) a family of visual sensing techniques that explore the domain of real-time learning onboard small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), (3) a demonstration system that combines information from such sUAS with intelligent ground-based sensors, and (4) the sketch of a new language framework, called TickTalk, that seeks to ease the programmer\\'s burden in creating software for such complex, heterogeneous, distributed, fault-prone systems.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n1:53 Observations\\\\n6:18 Adoption Depends on Behaviors and Habits\\\\n7:19 Some Implicit Criteria for Success\\\\n12:16 Corollaries to the OHIO Principle\\\\n17:21 An Hour in the Life of an OHIO Device Designed for a Five-year Mission\\\\n19:33 Application-Specific Time Accuracy Requirements\\\\n21:42 The Value is in Sharing Data\\\\n22:04 Programing Today\\'s Distributed System\\\\n23:17 Programming in the Cyber-Physical Network\\\\n24:06 A Perspective on our Challenges\\\\n25:58 Platformization and lannucci\\'s Law\\\\n26:44 Computing Platforms: Past and Present\\\\n35:27 Hypothesis: it will be the The Cyber-Physical Network\\\\n36:14 Design Parameters of this New Computing Platform\\\\n39:30 CCSG: Integrating Computing \\\\u0026 Communications\\\\n41:07 Projects\\\\n41:39 LongShot: Long-Range Synchronization of Time\\\\n43:13 Main Challenges\\\\n47:03 How accurately can we timestamp?\\\\n47:38 Semtech SX1276 Timing Characterization - Transmit\\\\n48:40 Approach\\\\n48:43 Two-Step Synchronization Result 3 Devices over a 2 hour period @ 4km\\\\n50:19 PowerDue: Power / Energy Aware Programming\\\\n55:26 Synchronized Multisensory Learning\\\\n55:54 ClickBAIT: Click-Based Accelerated Incremental Training\\\\n59:04 Results: Classification\"",

This ability facilitates both implicit and explicit interactions, e.g., navigation nearby other people as well as social conversations. As mobile robots become more capable in many domains, like health and entertainment, this kind of spatial reasoning becomes essential for them to integrate with and operate among people.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I will present recent efforts to advance computational spatial reasoning in order to enable more effective social robot navigation and human-robot interactions in unstructured environments. Some of these efforts are focused on fundamental perception abilities for mobile robot operation, like traversability estimation and conversational group detection. Others focus on joint perception and action for robot navigation. Overall, these efforts demonstrate the potential of machine learning to help advance social robotics, and emphasize the importance of studying group human-robot interactions.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral of the projects that will be presented in the talk are in collaboration with the JackRabbot group within the Stanford Vision \\\\u0026 Learning Lab.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

A key novelty of VVateR is its ability to enable visualization of cyber- attacks, the resulting process anomalies, and whether or not the anomaly is detected. VVateR is currently operational in iTrust. It is connected to two plants, namely a water treatment plant named SWaT, and a water distribution plant named WADI. Both SWaT and WADI are fully operational plants. VVateR is accessed by wearing a virtual reality headset where the user/gamer can move about and interact with the plant in the virtual space. This opens up the plants for remote worldwide research collaboration and aids in capturing context from the plant that Mixed Reality promises to bring to industrial settings. VVateR helps visualise the interconnectedness of various infrastructures and the effects of cyber-physical attacks through complex and dangerous scenarios that can be safely tested in a virtual setting. Observing slow historical plant operation and path of attacks at varying timelapse rates makes the process of reconnaissance and incident-analysis arguably faster and more visually engaging than an analysis of the database logs. By acting as a Digital Twin when connected to a simulator, one can come up with numerous attack/defense scenarios and serious gamified challenges for training purposes. All these factors increase the preparedness of operators, policymakers, governments, and other relevant stakeholders in strengthening their cities and Critical Infrastructures through security by design. Other relevant projects being done at iTrust will also be discussed in this talk.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

Technology is often designed as an intervention to manage or treat these changes. This framing can position health conditions as problems to address through design and can neglect the complexity and positive aspects of older adulthood. In this talk, I draw on critical perspectives from Human-Computer Interaction and Gerontology. I describe three ways in which technology design can help us understand and challenge stereotypes around aging as well as cognitive impairment. I will argue for a view that accounts for the ways that technologies position us as we age and, in turn, the way that this view can inform the design of new technologies to enrich the experience of growing older.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n1:06 Increase in Aging Population\\\\n1:26 Growing industry for health technologies for older adults\\\\n2:19 Older adults rejecting technology\\\\n4:28 Research Approach\\\\n6:34 Robotics for Aging\\\\n7:14 Discourse on Healthcare Robots\\\\n7:54 Older adults rejecting robots\\\\n9:34 Findings\\\\n13:14 Shifts in Aging Technology Design\\\\n14:58 Study design\\\\n16:06 Activities to preserve abilities\\\\n24:19 Others countering dementia narratives\\\\n25:09 Health Activism\\\\n26:11 Research Questions\\\\n26:27 Methodology\\\\n28:38 Showing mundane experiences\\\\n30:09 Sharing the complexity of life with\\\\n31:29 Moderation to maintain safety\\\\n32:35 Summary\"",

With machines connected by a high performance network in a data center, NTP can keep the clocks within a few hundred microseconds of each other, a clock skew that is fine for humans but not useful for distributed system software that can communicate between machines in a few tens of microseconds. In this talk I will describe the challenge of tightly synchronizing clocks in a data center and present Huygens, a new algorithm developed with my colleague Balaji Prabhakar\\'s research group that can synchronized data center clocks within few 10s of nanoseconds. Like NTP, Huygens requires no special hardware and simply exchanges messages between machines but uses a number of techniques that exploit the high-performance networks in data centers. The techniques include sending many more probe messages and then using sophisticated machine learning techniques and global knowledge to compute the clock adjustment operations to keep the clock synchronized.\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMWw6rRoeSpkiseTHzWj6vu\"",

Over half of these children will have spent at least four years in the education system.\\\\n\\\\nTechnological determinism solutions, such as simply providing one-to-one computing devices, have not successfully addressed this learning crisis despite a decade of trying and a billion dollars spent. But should we give up on technology to help a generation of young learners in emerging economies gain literacy? While adaptive systems have shown great success in increasing learning gains, most design and evaluation of such systems has been limited to WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) places. These technologies have the potential for enormous impact if they can serve the next billion learners in the Global South.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, barriers remain to harnessing the power of advanced educational technology for all learners. More than finding the right technology platforms - how can we can address the implicit values and practices embedded in these systems that differ across contexts? My talk describes several projects that have helped to re-imagine how these technologies can respond to diversity in cultural and socioeconomic contexts through leveraging three key factors: context-sensitive design, physical infrastructure, and human infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:44 Personalization\\\\n1:13 Virtual Agents\\\\n1:50 Social Robots\\\\n9:13 Distribution of Ed/EdTech Research\\\\n18:33 Costa Rica\\\\n21:44 Model Evaluation\\\\n22:47 Help-seeking behaviors differ\\\\n25:11 On-task collaborative behavior\\\\n26:41 An exchange.\\\\n28:31 Context-Sensitive Design\\\\n32:08 Flexible power options\\\\n36:36 Data Transport\\\\n38:21 Physical Infrastructure: \\\\\"",

    "desc": "Karthik Raghunathan and Arushi Raghuvanshi\\\\nCisco Systems\\\\nMarch 13, 2019\\\\n\\\\nConversational applications often are over-hyped and under perform. While there\\'s been significant progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in academia and a huge growing market for voice based technologies, NLU performance significantly drops when you introduce language with typos or other errors, uncommon vocabulary, and more complex requests. This talk will cover how to build a production quality conversational app that performs well in a real world setting.\\\\n\\\\nWe will demonstrate an end-to-end approach for consistently building conversational interfaces with production-level accuracies that has proven to work well for a number of applications across diverse verticals. Building successful conversational interfaces involves choosing the right use case, collecting clean and relevant data, and breaking down the NLU problem into a series of solvable sub-tasks. All of today\\'s most widely used conversational services have been built using a similar hierarchical NLU pipeline of domain-intent-entity classification that has become an industry standard, which we will discuss in detail.\\\\n\\\\nOur architecture further improves on this standard domain-intent-entity classification and dialogue management architecture by leveraging shallow semantic parsing. We observed that NLU systems for industry applications often require more structured representations of entity relations than provided by the standard hierarchy, yet without requiring full semantic or syntactic parses which are often inaccurate on real-world conversational data. We describe our approach and demonstrate how it improves the performance of conversational interfaces for non-trivial use cases.\\\\n\\\\nWe end the talk by discussing the additional challenges in building a voice assistant rather than a text-based chatbot. Large vocabulary domain-agnostic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often mis-transcribe domain-specific words and phrases. Since these generic ASR systems are the first components of most voice assistants in production, building NLU systems that are robust to these errors can be a challenging task. We describe a few potential methods for handling ASR errors in the NLU pipeline, especially in the entity classification and resolution component which is most susceptible to poor performance from ASR errors.\\\\n\\\\nAfter this talk, attendees will have a better appreciation for the challenges and nuances of building real-world NLU systems, as well as a high level understanding of the best practices and components needed to build their own production quality conversational assistant.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n3:35 Cisco Webex: Meetings, Messaging, Calling, Devices\\\\n6:33 Face Detection\\\\n7:46 Intelligent framing for clearer communication\\\\n8:23 Face Recognition\\\\n8:57 Noise Suppression\\\\n17:03 Building production-quality conversational assistants is one of today\\'s hardest Al challenges\\\\n19:30 With recent NLP advancements, why is building a production level conversational app so hard?\\\\n21:55 Selecting the right use case is essential\\\\n24:55 Conversational data is often collected via crowdsourcing tools\\\\n27:48 Key steps in a modern conversational application\\\\n28:34 Voice based conversational applications\\\\n28:58 Automatic Speech Recognition\\\\n31:15 Domain Classifier assigns the user query to a pre-defined domain\\\\n32:22 Domain Classification\\\\n32:53 Intent Classifier determines the user intent\\\\n34:08 Intent Classification\\\\n34:23 Entity Recognizer detects all relevant entities in the user query\\\\n35:35 Entity Recognition\\\\n45:12 Role Classifier assigns role labels to extracted entities\\\\n49:11 Role Classification\\\\n49:27 Entity Resolver transforms each extracted entity into its canonical form\\\\n51:41 Entity Resolution - Textual Features\\\\n52:28 Entity Resolution - Phonetic Features\\\\n56:00 Entity Resolution - Personalization Features\\\\n56:53 Entity Resolution on Noisy Voice Transcripts\\\\n58:16 Language Parser clusters extracted entities into meaningful entity groups\"",

For example, an employer might want to promote their job opportunities to people with certain skills, while simultaneously ensuring a broad range of demographics sees and applies to the job posting. Moreover, if the employer uses a fixed filter to sift out fraudulent applications, the filter will become less useful over time as both fraudulent and honest applicants shift their application contents to pass the filter.

In this work, we propose BabbleLabble, a framework for training classifiers in which an annotator provides a natural language explanation for each labeling decision. A semantic parser converts these explanations into programmatic labeling functions that generate noisy labels for an arbitrary amount of unlabeled data, which is used to train a classifier. On three relation extraction tasks, we find that users are able to train classifiers with comparable F1 scores from 5-100 times faster by providing explanations instead of just labels. Furthermore, given the inherent imperfection of labeling functions, we find that a simple rule-based semantic parser suffices.\\\\n\\\\nThe full paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03818.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:57 Machine learning can help you!\\\\n1:41 Traditional Labeling\\\\n2:31 Higher Bandwidth Supervision\\\\n2:55 Explanations Encode Labeling Heuristics\\\\n4:52 Babble Labble Framework\\\\n5:06 Explanations Encode Heuristics\\\\n6:32 Predicates\\\\n7:11 Semantic Parser I/O\\\\n8:41 Semantic Filter\\\\n9:30 Pragmatic Filters\\\\n10:20 Label Aggregator\\\\n13:13 Discriminative Classifier\\\\n14:05 Generalization\\\\n15:20 Datasets\\\\n17:17 Utilizing Unlabeled Data\\\\n18:22 Filter Bank Effectiveness\\\\n19:25 Perfect Parsers Need Not Apply\\\\n20:23 Limitations\\\\n22:16 Related Work: Explanations as Features\\\\n23:07 Related Work: Highlighting\\\\n24:29 Summary\"",

Computer users of today, by contrast, are likely to be using a touch screen device, perhaps while on-the-go, perhaps outside, perhaps surrounded by attention-grabbers like people, traffic lights, curbs, and signs. Users might be trying to interact while carrying luggage, wearing gloves, squinting in bright sunlight, or wiping rainwater from their screens. Unfortunately, however, today\\'s mobile devices know little about these challenging situations, and offer even less to users by way of help or support for interaction. A useful perspective is to view these challenges through the lens of ability, disability, and accessibility, given that these notions involve the interplay of personal, environmental, contextual, and social factors.

I deployed this project with Mozilla to reimagine accessible web browsing with disability advocates online. My second project, Dynamo, shows how structured human labor can help move efforts forward when they stall.

As the industry players race to develop ambitious applications such as self-driving vehicles, cashier-less supermarkets, human-level interactive robot systems, and human intelligence augmentation, major research challenges remain in computational methods as well as hardware/software infrastructures required for these applications to be effective, robust, responsive, accountable and cost-effective. Innovations in scalable iterative solvers and graph algorithms will be needed to achieve these application-level goals but will also impose much higher-level of data storage capacity, access latency, energy efficiency, and processing throughput. In this talk, Wen-mei Hwu presents on recent progress in building highly performant AI task libraries, creating full AI applications, providing AI application development tools, and prototyping the Erudite system at the IBM-Illinois C3SR.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Introduction\\\\n0:12 Erudite: A Low-Latency, High-Capacity, and High- efficiency System for Computational Intelligence\\\\n4:13 C3SR Core Faculty\\\\n6:08 Al Application Pipeline Example - Watson Jeopardy 2011\\\\n11:21 Automatic Generation of Sports Highlight and Analytics\\\\n12:36 Automatic Conference Reviewer Assignment\\\\n17:42 C3SR Al Task Libraries\\\\n22:15 Person Parsing\\\\n25:40 Example Application DL Inference Flow in the Cloud\\\\n29:07 Hardware Comparison - Same Model and Framework\\\\n30:46 Importance of Model Data Loading in DL Inference\\\\n34:18 Hardware for Watson Jeopardy! 2011\\\\n38:44 FlatFlash-Storage-class Memory\\\\n45:36 FlatFlash Architecture\\\\n45:56 Example: Performance Benefit for Graph Computation\\\\n46:43 A Simplified View of IBM Newell with NVIDIA Volta GPUs\\\\n49:53 Starting Point - Data Access Challenge (HBM)\\\\n51:44 Starting Point - Data Access Challenge (DDR)\\\\n53:26 Iterative Solver Example- If matrix fits into Host Memory\\\\n54:13 Triangle Counting Example\\\\n55:22 MCN Near-Memory Acceleration for Existing Scalable Applications performing computation near data\\\\n58:21 Comparison Against a Traditional SPARC Cluster\\\\n58:48 Erudite Step 1\"",

EDIs are a class of mixed-initiative user interfaces that enable users to specify tasks such as data extraction, cleaning, transformation, querying or analysis, in the casual and familiar language of examples. Through tools that Abouzied and her team have built and evaluated for data extraction (SEER and Texture), querying (DataPlay and Qetch), generation (Synner) and debugging data pipelines (WhyFlow), Professor Abouzied demonstrate that designing such systems brings together new methods from a variety of research fields and opens up exciting research opportunities not only in HCI but also in how we design data management systems.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

In this talk, we take this premise and explain how existing database index structures can be replaced with other types of models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of indexed data and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. We offer theoretical analysis under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and we will delve into the challenges in designing learned index structures. Through addressing these challenges, our initial results show that learned indexes are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70% in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. Finally, we will discuss the broader implications of learned indexes on database design and future directions for the ML for Database Systems research.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nAlex Beutel is a Senior Research Scientist in the Google Brain team working on neural recommendation, fairness in machine learning, and ML for Systems.

Innovations like RISC, superscalar, multilevel caches, and speculation plus compiler advances (especially in register allocation) ushered in a Golden Age of computer architecture, when performance increased annually by 60%. In the later 1990s and 2000s, architectural innovation decreased, so performance came primarily from higher clock rates and larger caches. The ending of Dennard Scaling and Moore\\'s Law also slowed this path; single core performance improved only 3% last year! In addition to poor performance gains of modern microprocessors, Spectre recently demonstrated timing attacks that leak information at high rates. We\\'re on the cusp of another Golden Age that will significantly improve cost, performance, energy, and security. \\\\n\\\\nThese architecture challenges are even harder given that we\\'ve lost the exponentially increasing resources provided by Dennard scaling and Moore\\'s law.

    "desc": "EE380: Computer Systems Colloquium Seminar\\\\nEfficient and Resilient Systems in the Cognitive Era \\\\nSpeaker: Pradip Bose, IBM T. J. Watson Research Center\\\\n\\\\nA focus on energy efficiency in the late CMOS design era, requires extra careful attention to system reliability and resilience to hardware-sourced errors. At the same time, the emergence of AI (cognitive) applications as a key growth segment is quite obvious. This talk will attempt to address the special challenges that next generation AI (or cognitive) systems pose, with a particular focus on next generation cognitive IoT architectures. We will discuss this primarily from the point of view of providing energy-efficient resilience in environments that are likely to have built-in vulnerability to errors. Such uncertainty stems not just from potentially error-prone (late CMOS) hardware designed for extreme efficiency, but also from algorithmic brittleness of the most prevalent forms of machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) solution strategies today. In that context, we will briefly examine the promise of the Adaptive Swarm Intelligence (ASI) architectural paradigm that we have recently started investigating at IBM Research. This is a form of distributed or decentralized computing applied to the world of mobile cognitive IoT, backed by resilient support from back-end cloud (server) systems. In addition to examining the promises of inherent system architectural scalability and in-field, continuous learning that ASI offers, we will argue (albeit philosophically!) about why this could open the door to new models of self-aware systems that mimic cooperative and conscious problem solving in a human setting. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nPRADIP BOSE is a Distinguished Research Staff Member and Manager of the Efficient \\\\u0026 Resilient Systems Department at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY. He has been involved in the design and pre-silicon modeling of virtually all IBM POWER-series microprocessors, since the pioneering POWER1 (RS/6000) machine, which started as the Cheetah (and subsequently America) superscalar RISC project at IBM Research. From 1992-95, he was on assignment at IBM Austin, where he was the lead performance engineer in a high-end processor development project (POWER3). During 1989-90, Dr. Bose was on a sabbatical assignment as a Visiting Associate Professor at Indian Statistical Institute, India, where he worked on practical applications of knowledge-based systems. His current research interests are in high performance computers, power- and reliability-aware microprocessor architectures, pre-silicon modeling and validation. He is the author or co-author of over ninety refereed publications (including several book chapters) and he also serves as an Adjunct Professor ar Columbia University. He has received twenty eight Invention Plateau Awards, several Research Accomplishment and Outstanding Innovation Awards from IBM. He holds the title of IBM Master Inventor. Dr. Bose served as the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Micro from 2003-2006 and as the chair of ACM SIGMICRO from 2011-2017.

I will then focus on our efficient active learning methods to build predictive models of humans\\'s preferences by eliciting comparisons from a mixed set of humans, and further analyzing the generalizability and robustness of the learned human models for safe and seamless interaction with robots.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nDorsa Sadigh is an assistant professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Her research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, learning and control theory, and algorithmic human-robot interaction. Specifically, she works on developing efficient algorithms for autonomous systems that safely and reliably interact with people. Dorsa has received her doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at UC Berkeley in 2017, and has received her bachelor\\'s degree in EECS at UC Berkeley in 2012. She is awarded the NSF and NDSEG graduate research fellowships as well as Leon O. Chua departmental award, Arthur M. Hopkin departmental award.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information about this seminar and its speaker, you can visit https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/180926.html\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems. Topics range from integrated circuits to operating systems and programming languages. It is free and open to the public, with new lectures each week.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more: http://bit.ly/WinYX5\"",

Going into the workshop, Glenn was at first focused on the efficiency that would be gained by offering his courses online: the content would be easier to get at and students would be able to access the content on their own time, at their own pace. However, the TwT workshop helped him to think differently about how to use online learning and its possibilities. Glenn shifted his thinking about the classroom from an information delivery platform to one creating and supporting a culture of behaviors to support a lifelong learning experience, ultimately making the learner responsible for their own learning experience. CEE 220A was offered online in summer 2018 via the Canvas learning management platform, with content integrated from the Open edX platform for a seamless and engaging learning experience. Glenn is continuing his work to develop online versions of 220B and 220C.\"",

Nevertheless, especially for large code bases, it would be nice if a compiler could find type errors before the code is even run. Optional static type checking promises exactly this, and over the past four years we have successfully introduced this feature into Python 3. This talk introduces the type system we\\'ve adopted and the syntax used for type annotations, some tips on how to get started with a large existing code base, and our experience using the \\'mypy\\' type checker at Dropbox. The entire system is open source, and has also been adopted by other companies such as Lyft, Quora and Facebook.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nGuido van Rossum is the creator of Python. Born in the Netherlands, he moved to the US following Python\\'s success.

    "desc": "EE380: Computer Systems Colloquium Seminar\\\\nTowards theories of single-trial high dimensional neural data analysis  \\\\nSpeaker: Surya Ganguli, Stanford, Applied Physics\\\\n\\\\nNeuroscience has entered a golden age in which experimental technologies now allow us to record thousands of neurons, over many trials during complex behaviors, yielding large-scale, high dimensional datasets. However, while we can record thousands of neurons, mammalian circuits controlling complex behaviors can contain tens of millions of behaviorally relevant neurons. Thus, despite significant experimental advances, neuroscience remains in a vastly undersampled measurement regime. Nevertheless, a wide array of statistical procedures for dimensionality reduction of multineuronal recordings uncover remarkably insightful, low dimensional neural state space dynamics whose geometry reveals how behavior and cognition emerge from neural circuits. What theoretical principles explain this remarkable success; in essence, how is it that we can understand anything about the brain while recording an infinitesimal fraction of its degrees of freedom?\\\\n\\\\nWe present a theory that addresses this question, and test it using neural data recorded from reaching monkeys. Overall, this theory yields a picture of the neural measurement process as a random projection of neural dynamics, conceptual insights into how we can reliably recover neural state space dynamics in such under-sampled measurement regimes, and quantitative guidelines for the design of future experiments. Moreover, it reveals the existence of phase transition boundaries in our ability to successfully decode cognition and behavior on single trials as a function of the number of recorded neurons, the complexity of the task, and the smoothness of neural dynamics. We will also discuss non-negative tensor analysis methods to perform multi-timescale dimensionality reduction and demixing of neural dynamics that reveal how rapid neural dynamics within single trials mediate perception, cognition and action, and how slow changes in these dynamics mediate learning.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nProf. Surya Ganguli triple majored in physics, mathematics, and electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, completed a masters in mathematics and a PhD in string theory at Berkeley, and a postdoc in theoretical neuroscience at UCSF. He is now a professor of Applied Physics at Stanford where he leads the Neural Dynamics and Computation Lab, and is also a consulting professor at the Google Brain Research Team. His research spans the fields of physics, machine learning and neuroscience, focusing on understanding and improving how both biological and artificial neural networks learn striking emergent computations. He has been awarded a Swartz-Fellowship in computational neuroscience, a Burroughs-Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface, a Terman Award, NIPS Outstanding Paper Award, an Alfred P. Sloan foundation fellowship, a James S.

People with cognitive disabilities benefit from easier communication, and better tools for scheduling and reminders. Will advances in machine learning enhance this impact? Progress in natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and emotion detection, all driven by machine learning, may deliver important benefits soon. Further out, can we look for systems that can help people with cognitive challenges understand our complex world more easily, work more effectively, stay safe, and interact more comfortably in social situations?

Such digitally mediated activities can be easily recorded, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study and measure intimate psycho-demographic traits using actual--rather than self-reported--behavior. Our research shows that digital records of behavior, such as samples of text, Tweets, Facebook Likes, web-browsing logs, or even facial images can be used to accurately measure a wide range of traits including personality, intelligence, and political views. Such Big Data assessment has a number of advantages: it does not require participants\\' active involvement; it can be easily and inexpensively applied to large populations; and it is relatively immune to cheating or misrepresentation. If used ethically, it could revolutionize psychological assessment, marketing, recruitment, insurance, and many other industries. In the wrong hands, however, such methods pose significant privacy risks. In this talk, we will discuss how to reap the benefits of Big Data assessment while avoiding the pitfalls.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\n\\\\nMichal Kosinski is the Assistant Professor in Organizational Behavior at Stanford University Graduate School of Business. His research focuses on humans in a digital environment and employs cutting-edge computational methods and Big Data mining. Michal received his PhD in Psychology from the University of Cambridge (UK) in 2014.

The new theory has the following components:\\\\n\\\\n1. rethinking Learning theory; I will prove a new generalization bound, the input-compression bound, which shows that compression of the representation of input variable is far more important for good generalization than the dimension of the network hypothesis class, an ill defined notion for deep learning.\\\\n\\\\n2. I will prove that for large scale Deep Neural Networks the mutual information on the input and the output variables, for the last hidden layer, provide a complete characterization of the sample complexity and accuracy of the network. This makes the information Bottleneck bound for the problem as the optimal trade-off between sample complexity and accuracy with ANY learning algorithm.\\\\n\\\\n3. I will show how Stochastic Gradient Descent, as used in Deep Learning, achieves this optimal bound. In that sense, Deep Learning is a method for solving the Information Bottleneck problem for large scale supervised learning problems. The theory provide a new computational understating of the benefit of the hidden layers, and gives concrete predictions for the structure of the layers of Deep Neural Networks and their design principles. These turn out to depend solely on the joint distribution of the input and output and on the sample size.\\\\n\\\\nBased partly on works with Ravid Shwartz-Ziv and Noga Zaslavsky.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nDr. Naftali Tishby is a professor of Computer Science , and the incumbent of the Ruth and Stan Flinkman Chair for Brain Research at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Science (ELSC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is one of the leaders of machine learning research and computational neuroscience in Israel and his numerous ex - students serve at key academic and industrial research positions all over the world.\\\\nProf. Tishby was the founding chair of the new computer - engineering program, and a director of the Leibnitz research center in computer science, at the Hebrew University.\\\\n\\\\nTishby received his PhD in theoretical physics from the Hebrew university in 1985 and was a research staff member at MIT and Bell Labs from 1985 and 1991. Prof. Tishby was also a visiting professor at Princeton NECI, University of Pennsylvania, UCSB, and IBM research.\\\\n\\\\nHis current research is at the interface between computer science, statistical physics, and computational neuroscience. He pioneered various applications of statistical physics and information theory in computational learning theory. More recently, he has been working on the foundations of biological information processing and the connections between dynamics and information. He has introduced with his colleagues new theoretical frameworks for optimal adaptation an d efficient information representation in biology, such as the Information Bottleneck method and the Minimum Information principle for neural coding.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information about this seminar and its speaker, you can visit https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/180404.html\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

This is done automatically and in real time. This scoring system has multiple applications. On the business side, the greatest potential is the possibility to adjust the price of an advertisement to the quality of the editorial context. There is room for improvement. Today, a story that required months of work and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars carries the same unitary value (a few dollars per thousand page views) as a short, gossipy article. But times are changing. In the digital ad business, indicators are blinking red: CPMs, click-through rates, and viewability are on a steady downward decline. We believe that inevitably, advertisers and marketers will seek high-quality content--as long as they can rely on a credible indicator of quality. Deepnews.ai will interface with ad servers to assess the value of a story and price and serve ads accordingly. The higher a story\\'s quality score, the pricier the ad space adjacent to it can be. This adjustment will substantially raise the revenue per page to match the quality of news.On the editorial side: The ability to assess the quality of news will open up opportunities for new products and services such as:\\\\n\\\\nRecommendation engines improvement: instead of relying on keywords or frequency, Deepnews.ai will surface stories based on substantial quality, which will increase the number of articles read per visit.

    "desc": "EE380: Computer Systems Colloquium Seminar\\\\nComputational memory: A stepping-stone to non-von Neumann computing? \\\\nSpeaker: Abu Sebastian, IBM Research - Z\\xc3\\xbcrich\\\\n\\\\nIn the advent of the data-centric AI era and the imminent end of CMOS scaling laws, the time is ripe to adopt computing units based on non-von Neumann computing architectures. A first step in this direction could be in-memory computing, where certain computational tasks are performed in place in a specialized memory unit called computational memory. Resistive memory devices, where information is represented in terms of atomic arrangements within tiny volumes of material, are poised to play a key role as elements of such computational memory units. I will present a few examples of how the physical attributes and dynamics of these devices can be exploited to achieve in-place computation. We expect that this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could enable ultra-dense, low-power, and massively-parallel computing systems.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nAbu Sebastian is a Research Staff Member and Master Inventor at IBM Research - Z\\xc3\\xbcrich. He was a contributor to several key projects in the field of storage and memory technologies. Most recently, he has been pursuing research in the area of non-von Neumann computing with the intent of connecting the technological elements with applications such as machine learning. In 2015, he was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) consolidator grant for this work.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information about this seminar and its speaker, you can visit https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/180307.html\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

These accounts were immediately suspended, removing the data from Twitter.com and Twitter\\'s developer API. In this talk, we show how we can reconstruct a subset of the Twitter network of these Russian troll accounts and apply graph analytics to the data using the Neo4j graph database to uncover how these accounts were spreading fake news.\\\\n\\\\nThis case study style presentation will show how we collected and munged the data, taking advantage of the flexibility of the property graph. We\\'ll dive into how NLP and graph algorithms like PageRank and community detection can be applied in the context of social media to make sense of the data. We\\'ll show how Cypher, the query language for graphs is used to work with graph data. And we\\'ll show how visualization is used in combination with these algorithms to interpret results of the analysis and to help share the story of the data. No familiarity with graphs or Neo4j is necessary as we\\'ll start with a brief overview of graph databases and Neo4j.\\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nWilliam Lyon is a Developer Relations Engineer at Neo4j, the open source graph database. As a software developer on the Developer Relations team, he works on building tools to integrate Neo4j with other technologies and helping developers build applications with Neo4j. He also leads the Neo4j Data Journalism Accelerator Program, helping data journalists use graphs to make sense of data. Prior to joining Neo4j, William worked as a software engineer for several startups, building software for the real estate, predictive analytics, and quantitative finance industries.

    "desc": "EE380: Computer Systems Colloquium Seminar\\\\nCombining Physical and Statistical Models in Order to Narrow Uncertainty in Projected of Global Warming \\\\nSpeaker: Patrick Brown, Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford\\\\n\\\\nA key question in climate science is How much global warming should we expect for a given increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide? One strategy for addressing this question is to run physical models of the global climate system but these models vary in their estimates of future warming by about a factor of two. Our research has attempted to narrow this range of uncertainty around model-projected future warming and to assess whether the upper or lower end of the model range is more likely. We showed that there are strong statistical relationships between how models simulate fundamental features of the Earth\\'s energy budget over the recent past, and how much warming models simulate in the future. Importantly, we find that models that match observations the best over the recent past, tend to simulate more warming in the future than the average model. Thus, statistically combining information from physical models and observations tells us that we should expect more warming (with smaller uncertainty ranges) than we would expect if we were just looking at physical models in isolation and ignoring observations. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nPatrick is a postdoctoral research scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford. He holds a Bachelor\\'s degree in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Wisconsin - Madison and a Ph.D. in Earth and Ocean Sciences from Duke University.He has interests in climate modeling, Earth\\'s energy budget, emergent properties of complex systems, chaos, statistics, climate-society interaction and quantifying difficult-to-quantify things. \\\\n\\\\nFor more information about this seminar and its speaker, you can visit https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/180117.html\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

Numerous technologies are emerging with this exact aim, from devices (transistors), memories, 3D integration, specialization, photonics, and others. This vast range of technologies with the same goal creates a grand challenge at the architectural and system levels of not only properly evaluating each technology at such a high level but also creating a strategy to pave a path forward for digital computing by making the best use out of all technology options. In this talk, I will provide the architect\\'s view with an overview of some promising emerging technologies, how they interact with each other, as well as discuss how to create methodologies to efficiently explore the vast design space that all these new options create. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nGeorge Michelogiannakis is a research scientist in the computer architecture group (CAG) in the computational research division (CRD). He has extensive work on networking (both off- and on-chip) and computer architecture.

Traditional computing treats bits, numbers, and memory pointers as basic objects on which all else is built. I will consider the possibility of computing with high-dimensional vectors as basic objects, for example with 10,000-bit words, when no individual bit nor subset of bits has a meaning of its own--when any piece of information encoded into a vector is distributed over all components. Thus a traditional data record subdivided into fields is encoded as a high-dimensional vector with the fields superposed.\\\\n\\\\nComputing power arises from the operations on the basic objects--from what is called their algebra.

Frank, Sandia National Laboratories\\\\n\\\\nWith the end of transistor scaling now in sight, the raw energy efficiency (and thus, practical performance) of conventional digital computing is expected to soon plateau. Thus, there is presently a growing interest in exploring various unconventional types of computing that may have the potential to take us beyond the limits of conventional CMOS technology. In this talk, I survey a range of unconventional computing approaches, with an emphasis on reversible computing (defined in an appropriately generalized way), which fundamental physical arguments indicate is the only possible approach that can potentially increase energy efficiency and affordable performance of arbitrary computations by unboundedly large factors as the technology is further developed \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nMichael Frank attended the world\\'s first class on nanotechnology during his Freshman year at Stanford in 1988, and received his B.Sci. in Symbo\\xc2\\xadlic Systems in 1991, after helping the Cardinal take home the world championship trophy in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. During his graduate work at MIT, his research interests zeroed in on the limits of computing. In 1995 he designed one of the first universal molecular computers using DNA, and, after finding that fundamental thermochemistry forced it to be reversible, he began studying more efficient electronic implementations of reversible computing for his Ph.D. After helping to design the world\\'s first fully reversible microprocessors, he graduated in 1999 and spent most of the next 16 years teaching and continuing his research at the University of Florida and the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. In 2015 he joined the Non-conventional Computing Technologies department at Sandia National Laboratories, where he is once again trying to help the world understand that it really needs to pursue reversible computing, so that civilization can extract unboundedly manyfold times greater total economic value from computation than would otherwise be possible. \\\\n\\\\nFor more information about this seminar and its speaker, you can visit http://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/171018.html\\\\n\\\\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

Since we know a lot about what flow state is and what it requires, you might imagine that game\\'s design to be a lot of work, but not mysterious. Yet 99% of all games fail. The vast majority of game designers have never designed an addictive game. In HCI research, games are analyzed based on flow state properties but that\\'s descriptive, not prescriptive. Designing such games remains mystical. Like other performing arts, game design needs accident, luck, inspiration, perspiration, and knowledge. I would like to justify my being invited to talk so on top of the skeleton of flow, I will add some meat that you would not likely hear from anyone else. I will talk about what I learned playtesting my own work and what I was taught by great game designers, in creating games that were indeed addictive. As such, this will be a very idiosyncratic and personal introduction to the art of designing irresistible engagement.  \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nChuck Clanton is a software user experience designer, who likes working on new problems.

    "desc": "Kurt Luther\\\\nVirginia Tech\\\\n\\\\nDespite the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words, images often need context to be meaningful to their viewers. In this talk, I show how expert-led crowdsourcing, a novel approach that combines the relative strengths of experts and amateur crowds, can be used to solve photo mysteries. In one example, I conducted a qualitative study of image verification experts in journalism, national security, and human rights organizations to understand how they perform geolocation, the process of mapping the precise location where a photo or video was taken. This research informed the design of GroundTruth, a system where experts collaborate with crowds to geolocate unknown images. In another example, I partnered with a historical photography magazine to develop Civil War Photo Sleuth, a system that leverages crowdsourcing and computer vision techniques to help experts identify unknown soldier portraits from the 19th century. I also discuss broader challenges and opportunities in crowdsourced investigations, open-source intelligence, and collaborative sensemaking illustrated by these examples.\\\\n\\\\nKurt Luther is an assistant professor of computer science at Virginia Tech, where he is also affiliated with the Center for Human-Computer Interaction, the Department of History, and the Hume Center for National Security and Technology. He directs the Crowd Intelligence Lab (http://crowd.cs.vt.edu), an interdisciplinary research group exploring how crowdsourcing systems can support creativity and discovery. He is principal investigator for over $1.5M in sponsored research, including an NSF CAREER Award. Previously, Dr. Luther was a postdoctoral fellow in the HCI Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.D. in human-centered computing from Georgia Tech, where he was a Foley Scholar, and his B.S. in computer graphics technology from Purdue University.

Over the past year, however, VR head-worn display developer kits have metamorphosed into early consumer products that are far superior to what most VR researchers previously had available. And compelling AR head-worn display developer kits are now being released that promise to beget everyday see-through eyewear. What can the upcoming generation of consumer AR make possible by interactively integrating virtual media with our experience of the physical world? I will try to answer this question in part by presenting some of the research being done by Columbia\\xc2\\x92s Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab to explore how we can support users in performing skilled tasks. Examples I will discuss range from providing standalone assistance, to enabling collaboration between a remote expert and a local user. I will address infrastructure spanning the gamut from lightweight, monoscopic eyewear, to hybrid user interfaces that synergistically combine tracked, stereoscopic, see-through head-worn displays with other displays and interaction devices.\\\\n\\\\nSteve Feiner is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University, where he directs the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab, and codirects the Columbia Vision and Graphics Center. His lab has been doing VR, AR and wearable research for over 25 years, designing and evaluating novel 3D interaction and visualization techniques, creating the first outdoor mobile AR system using a see-through head-worn display, and pioneering experimental applications of AR to fields such as tourism, journalism, maintenance, and construction. Steve received an A.B. in Music and a Ph.D. in Computer Science, both from Brown University. He is coauthor of Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, received the IEEE VGTC Virtual Reality Career Award, and was elected to the CHI Academy.

Online engagement throughout the lifespan has also become a critical aspect of full participation in society. While increasing numbers of older adults are now active online, late-life disability can make staying socially connected through technology difficult. In this talk, I will describe the complexities of designing social technologies for older adults with cognitive impairments and introduce prototypes that help understand how to bridge gaps in online participation. These systems leverage familiar communication interfaces that allow older adults to express themselves in new ways while also attending to the role of caregivers, therapists, and family members in social interaction. Drawing on my work with older adults, I will argue that the field of human-computer interaction faces pressing challenges around how to help people sustain their online lives throughout the lifespan.\\\\n\\\\nAnne Marie Piper is an Assistant Professor in Communication Studies at Northwestern University. She holds courtesy appointments in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and in Communication Sciences and Disorders. Her research in human-computer interaction investigates natural user interfaces to support communication, social interaction, and learning across the lifespan.

It is pivotal to one of the most established industries as autonomous driving changes the entire field from a sector providing a very hardware oriented product to offering personal mobility without the need to drive a car. Now, there are still many questions to be answered. As we are changing the paradigm of what an automobile is, not just technology solutions need to be found, but also business models will change and legal frameworks need to be adapted. This talk will look at the topic of autonomous driving from different perspectives and discuss what needs to happen to make a great vision become reality and change transportation forever. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nDr. Sven Beiker is a Management Consultant specializing in technology and strategy, particularly in the automotive and personal mobility sector.

It has grown out of academic labs to large-scale adoption in a short period of time. Recently, we at Google announced that we are now providing neural translations to our users. In this talk, I will briefly review the history of machine translation and explain our GNMT (Google\\'s NMT) system. I will talk about our approach to Multilingual NMT which aims to translate between multiple languages at the same time. This opens many interesting avenues for further research. Most notably, it enables us to perform Zero-Shot translation - the ability to translate between languages the model has never seen before. Further analysis of this phenomenon hints at a presence of an interlingua - a language independent representation.\\\\n\\\\nThis is joint work with many members from the Google Brain and Google Translate teams. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nMelvin Johnson received his M.S in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2015.

Recently, digital civics has emerged as a research area moving towardwith a comprehensive approach to designing for civic encounters where community engagement is a primary concern. As an example of these efforts, my lab worked with municipal officials, service providers, and city residents to design a community engagement playbook detailing best practices for city-scale engagement. The playbook, as well as the collaborative process that produced it, provides a roadmap for thinking through the kinds of systems that might populate the design space of city-scale digital civics. This talk will outline the community-based design process as well as the key points of intersection documented through the playbook. We will then spend time working through some of the key intersections documented in the playbook to imagine tools and processes to support them across different civic contexts.\\\\n\\\\nDr. Christopher Le Dantec is an Assistant Professor in the Digital Media Program in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His research is focused on the area of digital civics emerging from the intersection of participatory design, digital democracy, and smart cities. He is specifically interested in developing community-based design practices that support new forms of collective action through the production and use of civic data. After earning his Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing in 2011 from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he advanced theoretical and practice-based approaches to bridge the digital divide experienced by homeless families in the U.S., he has worked closely with the City of Atlanta and a range of community-based partners to explore new forms of civic participation through community-centered design inquiry. His research has direct impact on how policy makers and citizens work together to address issues of community engagement, social justice, urban transportation and development. In addition to publishing in a range of ACM conferences, he is the Community+Culture forum editor for interactions magazine and the author of Designing Publics (MIT Press).\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about Stanford\\'s Human-Computer Interaction Group: https://hci.stanford.edu\\\\nLearn about Stanford\\'s Graduate Certificate in HCI: https://online.stanford.edu/programs/human-computer-interaction-graduate-certificate\\\\n\\\\nView the full playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMyupDF2O00r19JsmolyXdD\\\\u0026disable_polymer=true\"",

A great deal of learning research has resulted in principles of learning that could be used to enhance education; however, the results of that research often have not translated into successful changes in teaching practice, educational technology design, or student learning. In this talk, I will describe a model for using educational technology to shift the relationship between learning research and teaching practice in service of simultaneously improving student learning and contributing to our fundamental understanding of human learning. I will also describe a new Open Analytics Research System (OARS) that we are developing at Stanford. The OARS collects fine-grained student learning data and models that data to make predictions about the learner. We will have an audience participation part of the session to leverage the HCI design expertise in the room to address the question of how to represent the data we have to help faculty using OARS make informed choices for the classroom. \\\\n\\\\nCandace Thille is the founding director of the Open Learning Initiative (OLI) at Carnegie Mellon University and at Stanford University.

    "desc": "Matt Gentzkow\\\\nStanford University\\\\n\\\\nWe study trends in the partisanship of Congressional speech from 1873 to 2009. We define partisanship to be the ease with which an observer could infer a congressperson\\'s party from a fixed amount of speech, and we estimate it using a structural choice model and methods from machine learning. The estimates reveal that partisanship is far greater today than at any point in the past. Partisanship was low and roughly constant from 1873 to the early 1990s, then increased dramatically in subsequent years. Evidence suggests innovation in political persuasion beginning with the Contract with America, possibly reinforced by changes in the media environment, as a likely cause. Naive estimates of partisanship are subject to a severe finite-sample bias and imply substantially different conclusions.\\\\n\\\\nMatthew Gentzkow is Professor of Economics at Stanford University. He studies empirical industrial organization and political economy, with a focus on media industries. He received the 2014 John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economic Association to the American economist under the age of forty who has made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.

    "desc": "Daniela Retelny\\\\nStanford University\\\\n\\\\nOnline crowdsourcing marketplaces provide access to millions of individuals with a range of expertise and experiences. To date, however, most research has focused on microtask platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. While microtask platforms have enabled non-expert workers to complete goals like text shortening and image labeling, highly complex and interdependent goals, such as web development and design, remain out of reach. Goals of this nature require deep knowledge of the subject matter and cannot be decomposed into independent microtasks for anyone to complete.\\\\n\\\\nIn this talk, I will present my dissertation research, which shifts away from paid microtask work and introduces diverse expert crowds as a core component of crowdsourcing systems. Specifically, I introduce and evaluate two generalizable approaches for crowdsourcing complex work with experts. The first approach, flash teams, is a framework for dynamically assembling and computationally managing crowdsourced expert teams. The second approach, flash organizations, is a framework for creating rapidly assembled and reconfigurable organizations composed of large groups of expert crowd workers. Both of these approaches for interdependent expert crowd work are manifested in Foundry, which is a computational platform we have built for authoring and managing teams of expert crowd workers.\\\\n\\\\nDaniela Retelny is a PhD Candidate at Stanford University in the Department of Management Science and Engineering. She is advised by Michael Bernstein and Melissa Valentine and is a member of the Center for Work, Technology and Organization and the Stanford HCI Group.

However, efficient parallel computing with ease of programmability still remains elusive. Shared memory multiprocessors and online Transaction processing systems make it easier on the programmer. Current systems either exclusively use physical time to order transactions, or logical time (e.g., Lamport clocks) and are limited in performance and/or scalability.\\\\n\\\\nWe introduce a new concept of time called physi-logical (physiological for ease of pronunciation!) time that combines the strengths of physical and logical time while avoiding their problems. The key advantage of physiological time is that it enables an application to move memory operations (load/stores) forward and backwards in time in order to avoid conflicts. We have designed, implemented and evaluated two time-traveling systems in the form of a new cache coherence protocol Tardis for multi-core CPUs and a new concurrency control algorithm TicToc for on-line transaction processing database systems. Both algorithms are simpler, more scalable, and perform better than existing state-of-the-art implementations.

The best design tools we have are still low-tech, like whiteboards and back-of-the-envelope calculations. Runway is a new tool to help design distributed and concurrent systems. It combines specification, simulation, visualization, and model checking into one tool, so you can write a single system model and do a bunch of useful things with it: the same model can help you evaluate a design\\'s correctness, availability, and performance while also helping others learn how the design works. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nDiego lives in San Francisco and works on distributed systems at Salesforce.

Sanders, University of Illinois\\\\n\\\\nAbsolute security is science fantasy, and perfection is the enemy of good. Good engineers realize the wisdom of that statement, and strive to develop tools, abstractions, and mechanisms that provide desired properties (like resiliency) with known certainty. But providing such properties at a specified level is easier said than done, especially for properties that are probabilistic and systems that are complex distributed combinations of hardware and software.\\\\n\\\\nThis talk explores attempts to provide cyber resiliency in systems that are used in critical applications. It argues that CAD tools are needed at design time to choose between alternative resiliency mechanisms, and that resiliency mechanisms are needed that provide redundancy, diversity, and adaptive behavior. It also argues that runtime sensing mechanisms need to correlate information from diverse sensors to expose attackers. Finally, it argues that by focusing on adaptation mechanisms that operate on effects rather than attacks, a system can tolerate many zero-day attacks. Taken together, we describe our work towards a pragmatic, but not perfect, approach to engineer resiliency into cyber systems for use in critical applications. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nWilliam H.

My talk will focus on two problems: concept learning and question asking. Compared to the best algorithms, people can learn new concepts from fewer examples, and then use their concepts in richer ways -- for imagination, extrapolation, and explanation, not just classification. Moreover, learning is often an active process; people can ask rich and probing questions in order to reduce uncertainty, while standard active learning algorithms ask simple and stereotyped queries. I will discuss my work on program induction as a cognitive model and potential solution for extracting richer concepts from less data, with applications to learning handwritten characters [2] and learning recursive visual concepts from examples.

At Baidu, we think that this is just the beginning, and high performance computing is poised to help.\\\\n\\\\nIt turns out that deep learning is compute limited, even on the fastest machines in the world. This talk will provide empirical evidence from our Deep Speech work that application level performance (e.g. recognition accuracy) scales with data and compute, transforming some hard AI problems into problems of computational scale.\\\\n\\\\nIt will describe the performance characteristics of Baidu\\'s deep learning workloads in detail, focusing on the recurrent neural networks used in Deep Speech as a case study. It will cover challenges to further improving performance, describe techniques that have allowed us to sustain 250 TFLOP/s when training a single model on a cluster of 128 GPUs, and discuss straightforward improvements that are likely to deliver even better performance.\\\\n\\\\nOur three big hammers are improving algorithmic efficiency, building faster and more power efficient processors, and strong scaling training to larger clusters. The talk will conclude with open problems in these areas, and suggest directions for future work. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nGreg Diamos is a senior researcher at Baidu\\'s Silicon Valley AI\\\\nLab (SVAIL). Previously he was on the research team at NVIDIA, where he contributed to the Volta GPU.

    "desc": "EE380:  Computer Systems Colloquium\\\\nA Topologically Optimal Internet\\\\nSpeaker:  Alan Huang, Ph.D, Terabit Corporation\\\\n\\\\nCurrent packet backbone networks are based on telephone, railroad, or highway networks. They were designed to minimize the total link length. Packet switched networks are different from circuit switched networks in that they should be designed to minimize the number of hops instead of the total link length. Minimizing the number of hops reduces the latency, power consumption, and cost. This also increases network efficiency by completely eliminating the \\xc3\\xa2\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\xc5\\x93bypass\\xc3\\xa2\\xe2\\x82\\xac\\xc2\\x9d packets that needless pass through the routers.\\\\n\\\\nIn more detail, the number of hops can be reduced by 2X by converting the network into a toroid. The number of hops can be further reduced by recasting the network into N-dimensional hypercube or into a multistage network, such as a Perfect Shuffle or Banyan. The multistage networks can be made redundant by adding an extra stage. This increases the fault tolerance and reduces the fabric blocking of the network. The reduced fabric blocking increases the network\\'s ability to carry voice and video. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) channels on existing optical fiber links can be connected together to implement these topologies. The DWDM channels decouple the network topology from the geographical constraints. These topologies are compatible with all the layers of the OSI stack. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Speaker:\\\\nAlan Huang is an expert in packet switching and optics.  While at Bell Labs, he worked on high performance packet switches for voice and video.  He co-invented the Batcher / Banyan switching network and helped design AT\\\\u0026amp;T\\'s first ATM switch.  He also managed the development of an optical pipelined processor, a photonic switching network, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL), planar optics, and ultrafast (\\\\u0026gt; 1Tbs) all-optical logic. After Bell Labs he helped start Terabit Corporation.  While at Terabit, he worked on scalable, fault tolerant routers, DARPA\\'s Next Generation Internet (NGI) project, and ultrafast optical networks. He has a BS and MS in EE from Cornell and a Ph.D. in EE from Stanford.  He has over 20 technical publications and 30 US patents.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaker Abstract and Bio can be found here: http://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/160928.html\\\\n\\\\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

Do you have any examples with middle or high school students?\\\\nThere will be examples across grade levels in the course, Effective Conversation in the Classroom, offered through scpd.stanford.edu.\\\\n\\\\n5. Hi Sara, I really liked your idea about recording conversations. How did you go about this in your classroom? What device did you use?\\\\nMost of our teachers used their smartphones or iPads to record the conversations of their students. Sara said she actually prefers digital recorder, which might be a little bit old-school, but some digital recorders have better mic to receive sounds. \\\\n\\\\n6.

The proteins encoded by Myb genes bind to DNA and regulate the expression of other genes that control cell division, differentiation, and cell death. The Myb proteins interact with a highly conserved multi-protein complex called the MuvB core. The same complex also interacts with proteins of the Rb tumor suppressor family and the E2F transcription factor family. Work from our laboratory has shown that Myb acts in opposition to Rb-E2F to epigenetically regulate gene expression. IN 2015 Joe was awarded the Walter J Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching.\"",

But established companies also face business model challenges. While they are able to engage in quieter periods of execution and continuous improvement of their business models, new opportunities or disruptions compel them to invent new business models. The few established companies that have managed to survive for over a century have done so by being able to successfully change their business models multiple times. One of these companies that has stayed out of the spotlight is The Fung Group. The Fung Group, established in 1906, operates behind the retail scene, orchestrating global supply chains for multiple products that are ultimately purchased by billions of consumers around the world.\\\\n\\\\nProfessor Haim Mendelson and Fung Group executive Dr. Leonard Lane discuss how the company has remained successful for over a century through continuous innovation and business model transformation.\\\\n\\\\nLearn more: http://create.stanford.edu\"",

This was deemed impossible at the time. Barry then went on to do a postdoc with Dr. Keith Yamamoto at UCSF where he worked on glucocorticoid receptor mutants. After that Barry entered the world of biotechnology where he was employed at three different companies designing small molecules that could specifically alter gene expression. He then stepped off the standard science track and took a job with Stanford University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Genetics running an outreach program called Stanford at The Tech. Over the next ten or so years Barry helped design and update a museum exhibition (Genetics: Technology With a Twist), a website (Understanding Genetics), have given over 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows the opportunity to improve their communication skills, and have written hundreds of blogs both for the Understanding Genetics website and for KQED QUEST, a local PBS television show.\"",

    "desc": "Ruth Tennen picked up her first pipette as a summer high-school student in a lab at the University of Connecticut Health Center. She received her bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in molecular biology from Princeton University and her Ph.D. in cancer biology from Stanford University. Her graduate work examined the intersection between epigenetics and disease: how human cells squeeze two meters of DNA into their nuclei while keeping that DNA accessible and dynamic, and how DNA packaging goes awry during cancer and aging. As a graduate student, Ruth shared her love of science by teaching hands-on classes to students at local schools, hospitals, and museums and by blogging on the San Jose Tech Museum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website.\\\\n\\\\nAfter completing her Ph.D., Ruth moved to Washington, DC to serve as an AAAS Science \\\\u0026 Technology Policy Fellow. Working in the Bureau of African Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, she collaborated with colleagues in DC and at U.S. Embassies abroad to promote scientific capacity building, science education, and entrepreneurship in sub-Saharan Africa. She managed the Apps4Africa program, which challenges young African innovators to develop mobile apps that tackle problems in their communities. She also traveled to South Africa and Ghana, where she delivered lectures and workshops designed to spark the scientific excitement of young learners.\\\\n\\\\nRuth is currently a Postdoctoral Lecturer in the Thinking Matters Program at Stanford University, teaching courses focused on developing first-year students\\' intellectual curiosity and critical inquiry skills in the realms of experimental design, bioethics, and the scientific and societal challenges of cancer. In her free time, Ruth enjoys running, reading, quoting Seinfeld, and cheering for the UConn Huskies.\"",

Dr. Snyder received his Ph.D. training at the California Institute of Technology and carried out postdoctoral training at Stanford University.\\\\n\\\\nHe is a leader in the field of functional genomics and proteomics, and one of the major participants of the ENCODE project. His laboratory study was the first to perform a large-scale functional genomics project in any organism, and has launched many technologies in genomics and proteomics. These including the development of proteome chips, high resolution tiling arrays for the entire human genome, methods for global mapping of transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-chip now replaced by ChIP-seq), paired end sequencing for mapping of structural variation in eukaryotes, de novo genome sequencing of genomes using high throughput technologies and RNA-Seq. These technologies have been used for characterizing genomes, proteomes and regulatory networks. Seminal findings from the Snyder laboratory include the discovery that much more of the human genome is transcribed and contains regulatory information than was previously appreciated, and a high diversity of transcription factor binding occurs both between and within species.\"",

In the last twenty years the structure of many industries has fundamentally changed facilitating the emergence of powerful new competitors. Often the biggest threat is posed by LCCs that are based in emerging markets, such as China and India. These companies can rapidly change from being small, local threats in their home market to challenging the premium market leaders in Europe and the US. Many industry-leading companies are still not paranoid enough about the LCC threat. In the webinar we discuss the challenge and its consequences with examples from a variety of industries, including many high technology business-to-business industries.\"",

Changing the way we interact with devices, haptics design thinking focuses on use of a touch sensitive interface rather than buttons or dials. \\\\nIn this webinar, Prof. Allison Okamura discuss haptics (the science and technology of the sense of touch), and in particular how it influences developments in the field of medical robotics. Touch is an often overlooked and undervalued sense, and creating touch-friendly human-machine interfaces can lead to novel and more effective designs. This is particularly true in medicine, where the treatment of patients usually requires physical interaction. Developments in haptics and medical robotics are presented in the context of the Design Thinking methodology. \\\\n\\\\nIt is clear that innovation is critical to customers and businesses alike, more so now than ever. This webinar series gives you a taste of what will be taught during the Innovation Masters Series - Design Thinking and the Art of Innovation (XDES400) course being held this December 12- 14, 2012 and June 19 -21, 2013 at Stanford University. http://scpd.stanford.edu/design\"",

He received his Masters from Stanford in the product design program in 1991 and has taught there periodically since 1996. He left Stanford with his degree and his design project -- a snowshoe. He turned his project into a business, creating the Atlas Snowshoe Company. His experience taught him several things: you can\\'t do anything significant on your own, you need a team; and engineering something is not nearly as much fun as marketing what you have engineered. In 2000, Perry sold his snowshoe business and moved to Southern California to run sales and marketing for Patagonia, an outdoor clothing brand. There, he got a chance to market on a global scale, learning to balance the need to drive sales while building a brand with important commitments and a sustainability message. In 2007 he took on a new challenge at Timbuk2, the original bike messenger bag company. As CEO of the San Francisco-based company, Perry focused on delivering custom products and an innovative customer experience. He implemented many techniques used at the d.school at Timbuk2. A founding faculty member of the d.school, Perry teaches classes including: Launchpad, Design Garage, d.Health, and d.leadership. He runs the executive programs for the d.school.\\\\n\\\\nProfessor Klebahn teaches in the Stanford Innovation and Entrepreneurship professional certificate program. This certificate delivers essential skills and effective strategies for working in and managing innovative organizations - and for starting new ones. Designed to engage and inspire, be prepared to get out of your chair and use your whole brain, because creativity and innovation take practice. \\\\n\\\\nA joint offering of the Stanford Center for Professional Development at the School of Engineering and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \\\\n\\\\nLearn more: http://scpd.stanford.edu/innovation-and-entrepreneurship/\\\\nApply now: http://bit.ly/SoKSVl\"",
