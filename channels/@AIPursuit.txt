But, this usually comes at the cost of high latency and computation, hindering their usage in resource-limited settings. In this work, we propose a novel approach for reducing the computational cost of BERT with minimal loss in downstream performance. Our method dynamically eliminates less contributing tokens through layers, resulting in shorter lengths and consequently lower computational cost. To determine the importance of each token representation, we train a Contribution Predictor for each layer using a gradient-based saliency method. Our experiments on several diverse classification tasks show speedups up to 22x during inference time without much sacrifice in performance. We also validate the quality of the selected tokens in our method using human annotations in the ERASER benchmark. In comparison to other widely used strategies for selecting important tokens, such as saliency and attention, our proposed method has a significantly lower false positive rate in generating rationales.

We show the teacher network can learn to better transfer knowledge to the student network (i.e., learning to teach) with the feedback from the performance of the distilled student network in a meta learning framework. Moreover, we introduce a pilot update mechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner in meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner. Experiments on various benchmarks show that MetaDistil can yield significant improvements compared with traditional KD algorithms and is less sensitive to the choice of different student capacity and hyperparameters, facilitating the use of KD on different tasks and models.\\\\n\\\\n@inproceedings{zhou-etal-2022-bert,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

Covariate drift can occur in SLUwhen there is a drift between training and testing regarding what users request or how they request it. To study this we propose a method that exploits natural variations in data to create a covariate drift in SLU datasets. Experiments show that a state-of-the-art BERT-based model suffers performance loss under this drift. To mitigate the performance loss, we investigate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) for finetuning BERT-based models. We discuss some recent DRO methods, propose two new variants and empirically show that DRO improves robustness under drift.\\\\n\\\\n@inproceedings{broscheit-etal-2022-distributionally,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

More specifically, we probe their capabilities of storing the grammatical structure of linguistic data and the structure learned over objects in visual data. To reach that goal, we first make the inherent structure of language and visuals explicit by a dependency parse of the sentences that describe the image and by the dependencies between the object regions in the image, respectively. We call this explicit visual structure the scene tree, that is based on the dependency tree of the language description. Extensive probing experiments show that the multimodal-BERT models do not encode these scene trees.\\\\n\\\\n@inproceedings{milewski-etal-2022-finding,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

Thus, the majority of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s languages cannot benefit from recent progress in NLP as they have no or limited textual data. To expand possibilities of using NLP technology in these under-represented languages, we systematically study strategies that relax the reliance on conventional language resources through the use of bilingual lexicons, an alternative resource with much better language coverage. We analyze different strategies to synthesize textual or labeled data using lexicons, and how this data can be combined with monolingual or parallel text when available. For 19 under-represented languages across 3 tasks, our methods lead to consistent improvements of up to 5 and 15 points with and without extra monolingual text respectively. Overall, our study highlights how NLP methods can be adapted to thousands more languages that are under-served by current technology.\\\\n\\\\nTo Cite: wang-etal-2022-expanding\\\\n@inproceedings{wang-etal-2022-expanding,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

We systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM), translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over 112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5% achieved by LASER, while still performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.\\\\n\\\\nTo Cite: feng-etal-2022-language\\\\n@inproceedings{feng-etal-2022-language,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

Unfortunately, existing prompt engineering methods require significant amounts of labeled data, access to model parameters, or both. We introduce a new method for selecting prompt templates without labeled examples and without direct access to the model. Specifically, over a set of candidate templates, we choose the template that maximizes the mutual information between the input and the corresponding model output. Across 8 datasets representing 7 distinct NLP tasks, we show that when a template has high mutual information, it also has high accuracy on the task. On the largest model, selecting prompts with our method gets 90% of the way from the average prompt accuracy to the best prompt accuracy and requires no ground truth labels.\\\\n\\\\nTo Cite: sorensen-etal-2022-information\\\\n@inproceedings{sorensen-etal-2022-information,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

Existing models for table understanding require linearization of the table structure, where row or column order is encoded as an unwanted bias. Such spurious biases make the model vulnerable to row and column order perturbations. Additionally, prior work has not thoroughly modeled the table structures or table-text alignments, hindering the table-text understanding ability. In this work, we propose a robust and structurally aware table-text encoding architecture TableFormer, where tabular structural biases are incorporated completely through learnable attention biases. TableFormer is (1) strictly invariant to row and column orders, and, (2) could understand tables better due to its tabular inductive biases. Our evaluations showed that TableFormer outperforms strong baselines in all settings on SQA, WTQ and TabFact table reasoning datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on SQA, especially when facing answer-invariant row and column order perturbations (6% improvement over the best baseline), because previous SOTA models\\xe2\\x80\\x99 performance drops by 4% - 6% when facing such perturbations while TableFormer is not affected.\\\\n\\\\nTo Cite: yang-etal-2022-tableformer\\\\n@inproceedings{yang-etal-2022-tableformer,\\\\n    title = \\\\\"",

First, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll briefly review some of what is known about the learning dynamics of deep neural networks, including highlights from the large-width limit of neural networks. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll then focus on efforts to understand empirical \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscaling laws\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the performance of neural networks. Recent empirical work has found that the test loss often follows smooth power laws as a function of basic variables such as model size and dataset size. I will discuss our work seeking to connect and understand some of these scaling laws. We introduce \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvariance-limited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cresolution-limited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scaling regimes to distinguish the origin of the power-law behavior. As an illustration, we investigate the case of teacher-student random feature models where we can study the problem exactly. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll close with a few empirical observations about task properties and scaling exponents.      \\\\n\\\\nSpeaker bio: Yasaman Bahri is a Research Scientist at Google Research on the Brain team. In the past several years, she has been working at the boundary of machine learning and the physical sciences, with a particular focus on bridging theoretical and empirical understanding in deep learning. Her doctoral work is in the area of theoretical condensed matter physics, specifically on quantum many-body systems. She received her Ph.D. in Physics from UC Berkeley (2017) as well as earlier B.A. degrees from UC Berkeley in Physics and Math. She is a recipient of the 2020 Rising Stars Award in EECS and the NSF Graduate Fellowship and has co-organized two ICML workshops. \\\\n\\\\nAbout the Yale Institute for Network Science (YINS): We produce and disseminate knowledge related to network science, in all its forms and applications. Network phenomena are now studied in many disciplines, including engineering, computer science, sociology, economics, political science, biology, physics, medicine, public health, and management. Hence, the study of networks is dramatically transforming scientific fields traversing engineering and the social and natural sciences. One of the major goals for YINS is to expose researchers to the phenomena, measurements, methodologies, and challenges of diverse disciplines. With this goal in mind, we proudly present the YINS Seminar Series, intended to promote the development and application of network science. Speakers include faculty from throughout Yale who are interested in networks, as well as distinguished guest lecturers who are scientists and innovators in the field.

To make progress in this direction, we study a smooth analogue of Q-learning. We start by showing that our learning model has strong theoretical justification as an optimal model for studying exploration-exploitation. Specifically, we prove that smooth Q-learning has bounded regret in arbitrary games for a cost model that explicitly captures the balance between game and exploration costs and that it always converges to the set of quantal-response equilibria (QRE), the standard solution concept for games under bounded rationality, in weighted potential games with heterogeneous learning agents. In our main task, we then turn to measure the effect of exploration in collective system performance. We characterize the geometry of the QRE surface in low-dimensional MAL systems and link our findings with catastrophe (bifurcation) theory. In particular, as the exploration hyperparameter evolves over-time, the system undergoes phase transitions where the number and stability of equilibria can change radically given an infinitesimal change to the exploration parameter. Based on this, we provide a formal theoretical treatment of how tuning the exploration parameter can provably lead to equilibrium selection with both positive as well as negative (and potentially unbounded) effects to system performance.\"",

In this talk, I will discuss recent work on language model pretraining, from ELMo, GPT, and BERT to more recent models. I will aim for broad coverage of the overall trends but provide more details on the models we have been developing recently at Facebook AI and the University of Washington. These include in particular pre-training methods for sequence-to-sequence models, such as BART, mBART, and MARGE, which provide some of the most generally applicable approaches to date.\\\\n\\\\nLuke Zettlemoyer is a Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science \\\\u0026 Engineering at the University of Washington, and a Research Scientist at Facebook. His research focuses on empirical methods for natural language semantics, and involves designing machine learning algorithms, introducing new tasks and datasets, and, most recently, studying how to best develop self-supervision signals for pre-training. Honors include multiple paper awards, a PECASE award, and an Allen Distinguished Investigator Award. Luke received his PhD from MIT and was a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh.\\\\n\\\\nslides: https://www.dropbox.com/s/337txp3f4voymem/slides.pdf?dl=0\"",

Thus, the agent can only use data previously collected by safe policies. While previous work considers optimizing the average performance using offline data, we focus on optimizing a risk-averse criteria, namely the CVaR. In particular, we present the Offline Risk-Averse Actor-Critic (O-RAAC), a model-free RL algorithm that is able to learn risk-averse policies in a fully offline setting. We show that O-RAAC learns policies with higher CVaR than risk-neutral approaches in different robot control tasks. Furthermore, considering risk-averse criteria guarantees distributional robustness of the average performance with respect to particular distribution shifts. We demonstrate empirically that in the presence of natural distribution-shifts, O-RAAC learns policies with good average performance.\"",

The answer is likely, yes. In machine learning, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdataset bias\\xe2\\x80\\x9d happens when the training data is not representative of future test data. Finite datasets cannot include all variations possible in the real world, so every machine learning dataset is biased in some way. Yet, machine learning progress is traditionally measured by testing on in-distribution data. This obscures the real danger that models will fail on new domains. For example, a pedestrian detector trained on pictures of people in the sidewalk could fail on jaywalkers. A medical classifier could fail on data from a new sensor or hospital. The good news is, we can fight dataset bias with techniques from domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning and generative modeling. I will describe the evolution of efforts to improve domain transfer, their successes and failures, and a vision for the future.\\\\n\\\\nSource: https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/3721\"",

Zhu - Recent Advances in Dialogues and Text Generation at ADAPT-Lab of SJTU \\\\n\\\\nShort Bio:\\\\nKenny Q. Zhu is a Professor of computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He graduated with B.Eng (Hons) in Electrical Engineering in 1999 and PhD in Computer Science in 2005 from National University of Singapore. He was a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer from 2007 to 2009 at Princeton University. Prior to that, he was a software design engineer at Microsoft, Redmond, WA. From Feb 2010 to Aug 2010, he was a visiting professor at Microsoft Research Asia in Beijing. Kenny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current research interests are natural language processing and knowledge engineering. He has published extensively in AI and NLP at top venues such as ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, IJCAI, SIGMOD, KDD, CIKM, ICDE. He has served on the PC of AAAI, IJCAI, WWW, CIKM, ECML, COLING, SAC, WAIM, APLAS and NDBC, etc. His research has been supported by NSF China, MOE China, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Morgan Stanley and AstraZeneca. Kenny is the winner of the 2013 Google Faculty Research Award and 2014 DASFAA Best Paper Award.\\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\\\n\\\\nAbstract:\\\\nIn this talk, I will present several recent research projects in dialog generation and text generation. First, I will attack the problem of automatically selecting a response in an open-domain dialogue, from a list of candidate responses. This is a form of dialogue system which can be modeled as a classification problem. Our main approach is to segment the dialogue context into sub-dialogues through the use of a special discourse parsers, and hence gain better and more efficient representation of the context. Then, I will present a novel problem of clarification question generation for product descriptions. When writing a brief textual description for a product, one may omit certain important details such as the dimensions and certain key features. Our techniques can be used in a writing assistant, that can automatically ask questions about these missing details given a product description. Finally, I will talk about a novel method to do abstractive summarization of text documents. Our method is driven by the intuition that human summarizes a text by first selecting a number of key sentences and then rephrase these sentences. We focus on a new effective way of doing the sentence selection that can achieve state-of-the-art results on the popular CNN-Daily and DUC benchmarks.\"",

The recent introduction of ensemble techniques has revolutionised this field, greatly increasing accuracy, but at a cost of increasing already burdensome computational overheads. I present new time series classification technologies that achieve the same accuracy as recent state-of-the-art developments, but with many orders of magnitude greater efficiency and scalability. These make time series classification feasible at hitherto unattainable scale.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShort Bio\\\\nGeoff Webb is Research Director of the Monash University Data Futures Institute.

Recently there has been increasing evidence that it might not be the best, though, and more research interest has focused to community models \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbeyond blocks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In this talk, we will propose one model, the hyperbolic community model, that subsumes many of the existing models. We will show the benefits of the proposed method and a case study of analysing social activity in Q\\\\u0026A networks. Finally, we will also present a method to find such communities. The method is based on less-known matrix concepts of (sub-)tropical matrix decomposition and rounding rank.\\\\n\\\\nBio: Pauli Miettinen is a Professor of Data Science and the head of Algorithmic Data Analysis group at University of Eastern Finland. Before joining UEF, he was a a senior researcher at the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, Germany.

He first gives an overview of the architecture of using self-attention to learn models and compares it with RNN.

Al-Antary\\\\n\\\\nDiabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a highly prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus, which causes lesions on the retina that affect vision which may lead to blindness if it\\\\nis not detected and diagnosed early. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are becoming the state-of-the-art approach for automatic detection of DR by using fundus images. The high-level features extracted by CNN are mostly utilised for the detection and classification of lesions on the retina. This high-level representation is capable of classifying different DR classes; however, more effective features for detecting the\\\\ndamages are needed. This research work proposes the multi-scale attention network (MSA-Net) for DR classification. The proposed approach applies the encoder network\\\\nto embed the retina image in a high-level representational space, where the combination of mid and high-level features is used to enrich the representation. Then a multi-scale feature pyramid is included to describe the retinal structure in a different locality. Furthermore, to enhance the discriminative power of the feature representation a multi-scale attention mechanism is used on top of the high-level\\\\nrepresentation. The model is trained in a standard way using the cross-entropy loss to classify the DR severity level. In parallel as an auxiliary task, the model is trained using\\\\nthe weakly annotated data to detect healthy and non-healthy retina images. This surrogate task helps the model to enrich its discriminative power for distinguishing the non-healthy retina images. The proposed method when implemented has achieved outstanding results on two public datasets: EyePACS and APTOS.\\\\n\\\\nMohammad T. Al-Antary received the B.Sc. degree in computer information systems from The University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree in enterprise systems and\\\\ndatabase administration/computing and information systems from the University of Greenwich, U.K., in 2017, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computing and information systems with the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences. He is currently working as a Teaching Assistant with the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, University of Greenwich. His research and professional interests include data science, medical image processing, machine learning, business intelligence, and big data.\"",

In recent years, search-based approaches have begun to explore improving software to consume less energy. Machine learning is a particularly strong candidate for this because it is possible to trade off functionality (accuracy) against energy consumption, whereas with many programs functionality is simply a pass-or-fail constraint. We use a grid search to explore hyperparameter configurations for a multilayer perceptron on five classification data sets, considering trade-offs of classification accuracy against training or inference energy. On one data set, we show that 77% of energy consumption for inference can saved by reducing accuracy from 94.3% to 93.2%. Energy for training can also be reduced by 30-50% with minimal loss of accuracy. We also find that structural parameters like hidden layer size is a major driver of the energy-accuracy trade-off, but there is some evidence that non-structural hyperparameters influence the trade-off too. We also show that a search-based approach has the potential to identify these trade-offs more efficiently than the grid search.\\\\n\\\\nAlexander E.I.

However, this line of research requires an uncommon confluence of skills: both the theoretical knowledge needed to design controlled psycholinguistic experiments, and the technical proficiency needed to train and deploy large-scale language models. We present SyntaxGym, an online platform designed to make targeted evaluations accessible to both experts in NLP and linguistics, reproducible across computing environments, and standardized following the norms of psycholinguistic experimental design. This paper releases two tools of independent value for the computational linguistics community:\\\\n1. A website, syntaxgym.org, which centralizes the process of targeted syntactic evaluation and provides easy tools for analysis and visualization;\\\\n2. Two command-line tools, syntaxgym and lm-zoo, which allow any user to reproduce targeted syntactic evaluations and general language model inference on their own machine.\"",

Here we mainly describe the evidence extraction component; this extracts from biomedical abstracts key pieces of information that clinicians need when appraising the literature, and also the relations between these. Specifically, the system extracts descriptions of trial participants, the treatments compared in each arm (the interventions), and which outcomes were measured. The system then attempts to infer which interventions were reported to work best by determining their relationship with identified trial outcome measures. In addition to summarizing individual trials, these extracted data elements allow automatic synthesis of results across many trials on the same topic. We apply the system at scale to all reports of randomized controlled trials indexed in MEDLINE, powering the automatic generation of evidence maps, which provide a global view of the efficacy of different interventions combining data from all relevant clinical trials on a topic. We make all code and models freely available alongside a demonstration of the web interface.\"",

Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in absolute gain. Finally, we show that our approach is useful in other domains as well, such as program synthesis.\"",

Therefore, in the last few years, an increasingly large body of work has been devoted to the analysis and interpretation of neural network models in NLP. This body of work is so far lacking a common framework and methodology. Moreover, approaching the analysis of modern neural networks can be difficult for newcomers to the field. This tutorial aims to fill this gap and introduce the nascent field of interpretability and analysis of neural networks in NLP. The tutorial will cover the main lines of analysis work, such as structural analyses using probing classifiers, behavioral studies and test suites, and interactive visualizations. We will highlight not only the most commonly applied analysis methods, but also the specific limitations and shortcomings of current approaches, in order to inform participants where to focus future efforts.\"",

State-of-the-art algorithms for solving these games typically perform full walks of the game tree that can prove prohibitively slow in large games. Alternatively, sampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization walk one or more trajectories through the tree, touching only a fraction of the nodes on each iteration, at the expense of requiring more iterations to converge due to the variance of sampled values. In this paper, we extend recent work that uses baseline estimates to reduce this variance. We introduce a framework of baseline-corrected values in EFGs that generalizes the previous work. Within our framework, we propose new baseline functions that result in significantly reduced variance compared to existing techniques. We show that one particular choice of such a function \\xe2\\x80\\x94 predictive baseline \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is provably optimal under certain sampling schemes. This allows for efficient computation of zero-variance value estimates even along sampled trajectories.\"",

Many learning algorithms have been proposed and shown to be successful when the test data and training data come from the same distribution. However, the best-performing models for a given distribution of training data typically exploit subtle statistical relationships among features, making them potentially more prone to prediction error when applied to test data whose distribution differs from that in training data. How to develop learning models that are stable and robust to shifts in data is of paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. Causal inference, which refers to the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect, is a powerful statistical modeling tool for explanatory and stable learning. In this tutorial, we focus on causal inference and stable learning, aiming to explore causal knowledge from observational data to improve the interpretability and stability of machine learning algorithms. First, we will give an introduction to causal inference and introduce some recent data-driven approaches to estimate causal effect from observational data, especially in the high dimensional settings. Aiming to bridge the gap between causal inference and machine learning for stable learning, we first give the definition of stability and robustness of learning algorithms, then will introduce some recently stable learning algorithms for improving the stability and interpretability of prediction. Finally, we will discuss the applications and future directions of stable learning, and provide the benchmark for stable learning.\"",

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.\"",

Analogies Explained: Towards Understanding Word Embeddings\\\\nWord embeddings generated by neural network methods such as word2vec (W2V) are well known to exhibit seemingly linear behaviour, e.g. the embeddings of analogy queen is to woman as king is to man approximately describe a parallelogram. This property is particularly intriguing since the embeddings are not trained to achieve it. Several explanations have been proposed, but each introduces assumptions that do not hold in practice. We derive a probabilistically grounded definition of paraphrasing and show it can be re-interpreted as word transformation, a mathematical description of wx is to wy. From these concepts, we prove the existence of the linear relationship between W2V-type embeddings that underlies the analogical phenomenon and identify explicit error terms in the relationship.\\\\n2.

They enable heterogenous non-linear operations to generalize the widely adopted convolution-based neuron model. This work introduces a fast GPU-enabled library for training operational neural networks, FastONN, which is based on a novel vectorized formulation of the operational neurons. Leveraging on automatic reverse-mode differentiation for backpropagation, FastONN enables increased flexibility with the incorporation of new operator sets and customized gradient flows. Additionally, bundled auxiliary modules offer interfaces for performance tracking and checkpointing across different data partitions and customized metrics.\"",

These photos represent a sparse and unstructured sampling of the plenoptic function for a particular scene. In this paper, we present a new approach to novel view synthesis under time-varying illumination from such data. We present a new approach for reconstructing light fields under the varying viewing conditions (e.g., different illuminations) present in Internet photo collections. Our approach builds on the recent multi-plane image (MPI) format for representing local light fields under fixed viewing conditions. We introduce a new DeepMPI representation, motivated by observations on the sparsity structure of the plenoptic function, that allows for real-time synthesis of photorealistic views that are continuous in both space and across changes in lighting. Our method can synthesize the same compelling parallax and view-dependent effects as previous MPI methods, while simultaneously interpolating along changes in reflectance and illumination with time. We show how to learn a model of these effects in an unsupervised way from an unstructured collection of photos without temporal registration, demonstrating significant improvements over recent work in neural rendering.\"",

Compilation techniques play a critical role in leveraging these small scale, noisy devices by driving down error rates in program execution. The compiler backend decomposes quantum operations into microwave pulses which aim to realize the desired quantum operations with the highest fidelity possible. We introduce OpenPulse, a pulse-level programming component of Qiskit, that hands over analog control of quantum computing systems to the user. Using OpenPulse, the user can specify the exact time dynamics of a program by scheduling arbitrary waveforms on control system resources, and can recover the time dynamics of the measured output. This is sufficient to allow the user to freely characterize, verify and validate the quantum system, and to explore gate optimization and error mitigation techniques to enhance system performance. OpenPulse enables the community to collectively push the field onwards towards practical computation.\"",

An outstanding scientific challenge in the community is a scalable set of metrics or experiments which can shed light on the usability of a device for near-term algorithms. Moreover, it becomes critical to explore techniques to extend the computational reach of noisy systems, be it through understanding underlying non-idealities, or more efficient circuit compilation. In this talk I will review the work we are doing at IBM to benchmark near-term quantum computers and I will discuss our recent results on quantum volume, large-scale entanglement and randomized benchmarking.\\\\n\\\\n*This work was supported by the Army Research Office under contract W911NF-14-1-0124\"",

It collects system configuration and logging data to find vulnerabilities using predefined rules. From a data science perspective, we are interested in the question of how we can automate rule development and system data analysis. In particular, I will talk about two projects: SAP data analysis and drift baseline suggestions. In the first project, we investigate data collected from users running SAP workloads. We leverage open source Business Intelligence dashboard, Superset, to visualize the relationship between user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s physical systems and SAP workloads running on them.\\\\nIn the second project, we look at all the systems in a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Insights account and recommend a standard system or a baseline. We use unsupervised machine learning methods to find central systems based on their hardware and software configurations. These baselines can then be used to troubleshoot operational issues and standardize configurations across systems.\\\\nThis talk will introduce the Insights data from an AI/ML perspective. You will learn about manipulating system data and dealing with common challenges faced in the process.\"",

(2) A huge amount of data of the Earth System is available from both observations and modelling. (3) Machine learning methods allow learning complex non-linear behaviour from data if enough data is available and to apply the learned tools efficiently on modern supercomputers. If you combine (1), (2) and (3), it is easy to see that there are a large number of potential application areas for machine learning in weather and climate science that are currently explored. However, whether these approaches will succeed is still unclear as there are also a number of challenges for the application of machine learning tools in weather predictions. This talk will provide an introduction to machine learning, outline how to apply machine learning in Earth System modelling, show examples for the application of machine learning throughout the weather and climate modelling workflow, and discuss the challenges that will need to be tackled.\"",

Anyone interested in building a deep learning model is only a quick search away from a number of clear and well written tutorials that will take them from zero knowledge to having a working image classifier. But what happens when you need to deploy these models in a production setting? At Salesforce, we use TensorFlow models to help us provide customers with insights into their data, and we do this as close to real-time as possible. Designing these systems in a scalable manner requires overcoming a number of design challenges, but the core component is Docker. Docker enables us to design highly scalable systems by allowing us to focus on service interactions, rather than how our services will interact with the hardware. Docker is also at the core of our test infrastructure, allowing developers and data scientists to build and test the system in an end to end manner on their local machines. While some of this may sound complex, the core message is simplicity - Docker allows us to focus on the aspects of the system that matter, greatly simplifying our lives.\"",

HE IS TRULY INSPIRING!!!\\\\n\\\\nNB: We recommend watching these videos through https://course.fast.ai rather than directly on YouTube, to get access to the searchable transcript, interactive notebooks, setup guides, questionnaires, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nWe finish this course with a full lesson on natural language processing (NLP). Modern NLP depends heavily on *self-supervised learning*, and in particular the use of *language models*.\\\\n\\\\nPretrained language models are fine-tuned, in order to benefit from transfer learning. Unlike computer vision, fine-tuning in NLP can take advantage of an extra step, which is the use of self-supervised learning on the target dataset.\\\\n\\\\nBefore we can do any modeling with text data, we first have to tokenize and numericalize it. There are a number of approaches to tokenization, and which you choose will depend on your language and dataset.\\\\n\\\\nNLP models use the same basic approach of *entity embedding* that we\\'ve seen before, except that for text data it\\'s called `word embedding`. The method, however, is nearly identical.\\\\n\\\\nNLP models have to handle documents of varying sizes, so they require a somewhat different architecture, such as a *recurrent neural network* (RNN). It turns out that an RNN is basically just a regular deep net, which has been refactored using a loop.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, simple RNNs suffer from exploding gradients, so we have to use methods such as the LSTM cell to avoid this problem.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, we look at some tricks to improve the results of our NLP models, such as additional regularization approaches, including various types of *dropout*, and activation regularization, as well as looking at weight tying.\"",

We use this to improve the results of our collaborative filtering model, and then look at other architectures for collaborative filtering. We also discuss the important question of how to use collaborative filtering in practice, such as when you don\\'t have data about some users of products.\\\\n\\\\nAfter wrapping up collaborative filtering, we move on to the critically important issue of tabular data analysis. We learn about the different types of variables used in tabular modeling, and how we can deal with them. We dive particularly deeply into an under-appreciated method for handling categorical data: entity embeddings.\\\\n\\\\nWe then discuss the use of decision trees, and ensembles of decision trees (random forests and gradient boosting machines) for tabular data. We look particularly closely at how random forests allow us to develop a deeper understanding of our data through explainability techniques.\\\\n\\\\nWe also discuss the limitations of decision tree approaches, particularly when it comes to extrapolation, and look at ways around this problem.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, we discuss how to use deep learning for tabular analysis, and how to create ensembles of multiple types of model.

Nevertheless, recently it has been shown to be possible to give a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum distortion, and some recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the piece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness certification for extit{general} activation functions still remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general framework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation functions. The novelty in our algorithm consists of bounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence allowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to the four popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we facilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively selecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental results show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified lower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while having comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general activation functions, including tanh, sigmoid and arctan. To the best of our knowledge, CROWN is the first framework that can efficiently certify non-trivial robustness for general activation functions in neural networks.\\\\n\\\\nThis talk will present recent progress from our research team on adversarial robustness of AI models, including attack, defense, and certification methods. The presentation will focus on our recent publications from AAAI 2019, ICLR 2019, AAAI 2018, ACL 2018, ICLR 2018, ECCV 2018 and NeurIPS 2018. We will introduce query-efficient and practical black-box adversarial attacks (i.e. AutoZOOM and hard-label attack), an effective defense to audio adversarial examples (i.e. temporal dependency), and efficient robustness evaluation and certification tools (i.e. CROWN and CNN-Cert)\\\\n\\\\nbio: Pin-Yu Chen is a research staff member of IBM Research AI.

Therefore, it is of great significance to locate the fracture in time. However, the manual detection is time-consuming and laborious, and the previous studies for the automatic detection could not achieve the accuracy and robustness for clinical application. In this work, based on the Faster R-CNN, we propose a novel method for more accurate skull fracture detection results, and we name it as the Skull R-CNN. Guiding by the morphological features of the skull, a skeleton-based region proposal method is proposed to make candidate boxes more concentrated in key regions and reduced invalid boxes. With this advantage, the region proposal network in Faster R-CNN is removed for less computation. On the other hand, a novel full resolution feature network is constructed to obtain more precise features to make the model more snesetive to small objects. Experiment results showed that most of skull fractures could be detected correctly by the proposed method in a short time. Compared to the previous works on the skull fracture detecion, Skull R-CNN significantly reduces the less false positives, and keeps a high sensitivity.\"",

Particularly, we leverage a classical tightness prior to a deep learning setting via imposing a set of constraints on the network outputs. Such a powerful topological prior prevents solutions from excessive shrinking by enforcing any horizontal or vertical line within the bounding box to contain, at least, one pixel of the foreground region. Furthermore, we integrate our deep tightness prior with a global background emptiness constraint, guiding training with information outside the bounding box. We demonstrate experimentally that such a global constraint is much more powerful than standard cross-entropy for the background class. Our optimization problem is challenging as it takes the form of a large set of inequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks. We solve it with sequence of unconstrained losses based on a recent powerful extension of the log-barrier method, which is well-known in the context of interior-point methods. This accommodates standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive and unstable Lagrangian dual steps and projections. Extensive experiments over two different public data sets and applications (prostate and brain lesions) demonstrate that the synergy between our global tightness and emptiness priors yield very competitive performances, approaching full supervision and outperforming significantly DeepCut. Furthermore, our approach removes the need for computationally expensive proposal generation. Our code is shared publicly.\"",

Specifically, the system should be accurate for classes seen during training while providing calibrated estimates of uncertainty for abnormalities and unseen classes. To efficiently estimate predictive uncertainty, we propose the use of multi-head convolutional neural networks (M-heads). We compare its performance to related and more prevalent approaches, such as deep ensembles, on the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. To this end, we evaluate models, trained to discriminate normal lymph node tissue from breast cancer metastases, on lymph nodes containing lymphoma. We show the ability to discriminate between the in-distribution lymph node tissue and lymphoma by evaluating the AUROC based on the uncertainty signal. Here, the best performing multi-head CNN (91.7) outperforms both Monte Carlo dropout (86.5) and deep ensembles (86.8). Furthermore, we show that the meta-loss function of M-heads improves OOD detection in terms of AUROC from 87.4 to 88.7.\"",

To help physicians reduce the potential risks of diagnosis, an image translation method is adopted. In this work, we proposed a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method to directly learn the mapping relationship between structure fundus images and fundus fluorescence angiography (FFA) images. Moreover, local saliency maps, which define each pixel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s importance, are used to define a novel saliency loss in the GAN cost function. This facilitates more accurate learning of small-vessel and fluorescein leakage features. The proposed method was validated on our dataset and the publicly available Isfahan MISP dataset with the metrics of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accurately generate both retinal vascular and fluorescein leakage structures, which has great practical significance for clinical diagnosis and analysis.\"",

However, high unavailability of such annotated dataset and tedious labeling process enforce us to discover a way for training with unlabeled dataset. In this paper, we propose a network named CellSegUDA for cell segmentation on the unlabeled dataset (target domain). It is achieved by applying unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) technique with the help of another labeled dataset (source domain) that may come from other organs or sources. We validate our proposed CellSegUDA on two public cell segmentation datasets and obtain significant improvement as compared with the baseline methods. Finally, considering the scenario when we have a small number of annotations available from the target domain, we extend our work to CellSegSSDA, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) based approach. Our SSDA model also gives excellent results which are quite close to the fully-supervised upper bound in target domain.\"",

Such a system should be capable of conversing about arbitrary topics (Paradigm 1: open-domain dialogue systems), and simultaneously assist humans with completing a wide range of tasks with well-defined semantics such as restaurant search and booking, customer service applications, or ticket bookings (Paradigm 2: task-based dialogue systems).\\\\n\\\\nThe recent developmental leaps in conversational AI technology are undoubtedly linked to more and more sophisticated deep learning algorithms that capture patterns in increasing amounts of data generated by various data collection mechanisms. The goal of this tutorial is therefore twofold. First, it aims at familiarising the research community with the recent advances in algorithmic design of statistical dialogue systems for both open-domain and task-based dialogue paradigms. The focus of the tutorial is on recently introduced end-to-end learning for dialogue systems and their relation to more common modular systems. In theory, learning end-to-end from data offers seamless and unprecedented portability of dialogue systems to a wide spectrum of tasks and languages. From a practical point of view, there are still plenty of research challenges and opportunities remaining: in this tutorial we analyse this gap between theory and practice, and introduce the research community with the main advantages as well as with key practical limitations of current end-to-end dialogue learning.\\\\n\\\\nThe critical requirement of each statistical dialogue system is the data at hand. The system cannot provide assistance for the task without having appropriate task-related data to learn from. Therefore, the second major goal of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current approaches to data collection for dialogue, and analyse the current gaps and challenges with diverse data collection protocols, as well as their relation to and current limitations of data-driven end-to-end dialogue modeling. We will again analyse this relation and limitations both from research and industry perspective, and provide key insights on the application of state-of-the-art methodology into industry-scale conversational AI systems.\"",

Among them, solutions based on the Deep Neural Network (or DNN) have produced tremendous success in various applications including computer vision, natural language processing, etc. Nevertheless, one common concern for DNN-based solutions is that they are generally very complicated and can hardly be understood by human beings. This talk focuses on a specific type of deep neural networks called recurrent neural networks (RNN). It will not only demonstrate the power of an RNN model to learn from implicit information but also explain why the overwhelming performance can be achieved given its architecture.\\\\n\\\\nSlides not

Such a system should be capable of conversing about arbitrary topics (Paradigm 1: open-domain dialogue systems), and simultaneously assist humans with completing a wide range of tasks with well-defined semantics such as restaurant search and booking, customer service applications, or ticket bookings (Paradigm 2: task-based dialogue systems).\\\\n\\\\nThe recent developmental leaps in conversational AI technology are undoubtedly linked to more and more sophisticated deep learning algorithms that capture patterns in increasing amounts of data generated by various data collection mechanisms. The goal of this tutorial is therefore twofold. First, it aims at familiarising the research community with the recent advances in algorithmic design of statistical dialogue systems for both open-domain and task-based dialogue paradigms. The focus of the tutorial is on recently introduced end-to-end learning for dialogue systems and their relation to more common modular systems. In theory, learning end-to-end from data offers seamless and unprecedented portability of dialogue systems to a wide spectrum of tasks and languages. From a practical point of view, there are still plenty of research challenges and opportunities remaining: in this tutorial we analyse this gap between theory and practice, and introduce the research community with the main advantages as well as with key practical limitations of current end-to-end dialogue learning.\\\\n\\\\nThe critical requirement of each statistical dialogue system is the data at hand. The system cannot provide assistance for the task without having appropriate task-related data to learn from. Therefore, the second major goal of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current approaches to data collection for dialogue, and analyse the current gaps and challenges with diverse data collection protocols, as well as their relation to and current limitations of data-driven end-to-end dialogue modeling. We will again analyse this relation and limitations both from research and industry perspective, and provide key insights on the application of state-of-the-art methodology into industry-scale conversational AI systems.\"",

We train a sequence Transformer to auto-regressively predict pixels, without incorporating knowledge of the 2D input structure. Despite training on low-resolution ImageNet without labels, we find that a GPT-2 scale model learns strong image representations as measured by linear probing, fine-tuning, and low-data classification. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 96.3% accuracy with a linear probe, outperforming a supervised Wide ResNet, and 99.0% accuracy with full fine-tuning, matching the top supervised pre-trained models. We are also competitive with self-supervised benchmarks on ImageNet when substituting pixels for a VQVAE encoding, achieving 69.0% top-1 accuracy on a linear probe of our features.\"",

Topics include the study of multi-modal representations, translation between modalities, bootstrapping of labels from one modality into another, visually-grounded question answering, segmentation and storytelling, and grounding the meaning of language in visual data. An ever-increasing number of tasks and datasets are appearing around this recently-established field. \\\\n\\\\nAt NeurIPS 2018, we released the How2 data-set, containing more than 85,000 (2000h) videos, with audio, transcriptions, translations, and textual summaries. We believe it presents an ideal resource to bring together researchers working on the previously mentioned separate tasks around a single, large dataset. This rich dataset will facilitate the comparison of tools and algorithms, and hopefully foster the creation of additional annotations and tasks. We want to foster discussion about useful tasks, metrics, and labeling techniques, in order to develop a better understanding of the role and value of multi-modality in vision and language. We seek to create a venue to encourage collaboration between different sub-fields, and help establish new research directions and collaborations that we believe will sustain machine learning research for years to come.\"",

They range from modular systems, systems that perform manual decomposition of the problem, systems where the components are optimized independently, and a large number of rules are programmed manually, to end-to-end deep-learning frameworks. Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s systems rely on a subset of the following: camera images, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, and active 3D sensors (LIDAR, radar). There is a general agreement that much of the self-driving software stack will continue to incorporate some form of machine learning in any of the above mentioned systems in the future.\\\\n\\\\nSelf-driving cars present one of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest challenges and opportunities for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Despite substantial investments, existing methods for building autonomous vehicles have not yet succeeded, i.e., there are no driverless cars on public roads today without human safety drivers. Nevertheless, a few groups have started working on extending the idea of learned tasks to larger functions of autonomous driving. Initial results on learned road following are very promising.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of this workshop is to explore ways to create a framework that is capable of learning autonomous driving capabilities beyond road following, towards fully driverless cars. The workshop will consider the current state of learning applied to autonomous vehicles and will explore how learning may be used in future systems. The workshop will span both theoretical frameworks and practical issues especially in the area of deep learning.\"",

Many learning algorithms have been proposed and shown to be successful when the test data and training data come from the same distribution. However, the best-performing models for a given distribution of training data typically exploit subtle statistical relationships among features, making them potentially more prone to prediction error when applied to test data whose distribution differs from that in training data. How to develop learning models that are stable and robust to shifts in data is of paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. Causal inference, which refers to the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect, is a powerful statistical modeling tool for explanatory and stable learning. In this tutorial, we focus on causal inference and stable learning, aiming to explore causal knowledge from observational data to improve the interpretability and stability of machine learning algorithms. First, we will give an introduction to causal inference and introduce some recent data-driven approaches to estimate causal effect from observational data, especially in the high dimensional settings. Aiming to bridge the gap between causal inference and machine learning for stable learning, we first give the definition of stability and robustness of learning algorithms, then will introduce some recently stable learning algorithms for improving the stability and interpretability of prediction. Finally, we will discuss the applications and future directions of stable learning, and provide the benchmark for stable learning.\"",

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\"",

Most recent work is based on sequence-to-sequence neural models similar to those used for machine translation (MT). Different from MT, TS data comprises more elaborate transformations, such as sentence splitting. It can also contain multiple simplifications of the same original text targeting different audiences, such as school grade levels. We explore these two features of TS to build models tailored for specific grade levels. Our approach uses a standard sequence-to-sequence architecture where the original sequence is annotated with information about the target audience and/or the (predicted) type of simplification operation. We show that it outperforms state-of-the-art TS approaches (up to 3 and 12 BLEU and SARI points, respectively), including when training data for the specific complex-simple combination of grade levels is not available, i.e. zero-shot learning.\"",

WSD corpora are typically small in size, owing to an expensive annotation process. Current supervised WSD methods treat senses as discrete labels and also resort to predicting the Most-Frequent-Sense (MFS) for words unseen during training. This leads to poor performance on rare and unseen senses. To overcome this challenge, we propose Extended WSD Incorporating Sense Embeddings (EWISE), a supervised model to perform WSD by predicting over a continuous sense embedding space as opposed to a discrete label space. This allows EWISE to generalize over both seen and unseen senses, thus achieving generalized zero-shot learning. To obtain target sense embeddings, EWISE utilizes sense definitions. EWISE learns a novel sentence encoder for sense definitions by using WordNet relations and also ConvE, a recently proposed knowledge graph embedding method. We also compare EWISE against other sentence encoders pretrained on large corpora to generate definition embeddings. EWISE achieves new state-of-the-art WSD performance.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1568/\"",

The convergence of large-scale annotated datasets and affordable GPU hardware has allowed the training of neural networks for data analysis tasks which were previously addressed with hand-crafted features. Architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and Q-nets for reinforcement learning have shaped a brand new scenario in signal processing. This course will cover the basic principles and applications of deep learning to computer vision problems, such as image classification, object detection or image captioning.\"",

Our experiments on the EPIC-Kitchen and Places Audio Caption datasets show that introducing the human-generated textual transcriptions of the spoken narratives helps to the training procedure yielding to get better embedding representations. The triad speech, image and words allows for a better estimate of the point embedding and show an improving of the performance within tasks like image and speech retrieval, even when the third modality, text, is not present in the task.\"",

Drawing inspiration from that, we approach the problem of learning an arrow of time in a Markov (Decision) Process. We illustrate how a learned arrow of time can capture salient information about the environment, which in turn can be used to measure reachability, detect side-effects and to obtain an intrinsic reward signal. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to parameterize the problem at hand and learn an arrow of time with a function approximator (here, a deep neural network). Our empirical results span a selection of discrete and continuous environments, and demonstrate for a class of stochastic processes that the learned arrow of time agrees reasonably well with a well known notion of an arrow of time due to Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto (1998).\"",

In particular, we focus on how to factor a joint distribution into appropriate conditionals, consistent with the causal directions. We explain when this can work, using the assumption that the changes in distributions are localized (e.g. to one of the marginals, for example due to an intervention on one of the variables). We prove that under this assumption of localized changes in causal mechanisms, the correct causal graph will tend to have only a few of its parameters with non-zero gradient, i.e. that need to be adapted (those of the modified variables). We argue and observe experimentally that this leads to faster adaptation, and use this property to define a meta-learning surrogate score which, in addition to a continuous parametrization of graphs, would favour correct causal graphs. Finally, motivated by the AI agent point of view (e.g. of a robot discovering its environment autonomously), we consider how the same objective can discover the causal variables themselves, as a transformation of observed low-level variables with no causal meaning. Experiments in the two-variable case validate the proposed ideas and theoretical results.\"",

These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among \\\\\\\\textit{(domain, slot)} pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time.\"",

These high-level variables also seem to satisfy very peculiar characteristics which low-level data (like images or sounds) do not share, and this work is about characterizing these characteristics in the form of priors which can guide the design of machine learning systems benefitting from these priors. Since these priors are not just about their joint distribution (e.g. it has a sparse factor graph) but also about how the distribution changes (typically by causal interventions), this analysis may also help to build machine learning systems which can generalize better out-of-distribution. There are fascinating connections between these priors and what is hypothesized about conscious processing in the brain, with conscious processing allowing us to reason (i.e., perform chains of inferences about the past and the future, as well as credit assignment) at the level of these high-level variables. This involves attention mechanisms and short-term memory to form a bottleneck of information being broadcast around the brain between different parts of it, as we focus on different high-level variables and some of their interactions. The presentation summarizes a few recent results using some of these ideas for discovering causal structure and modularizing recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms in order to obtain better out-of-distribution generalization.\\\\n\\\\nYann LeCun (The Future is Self-Supervised): Humans and animals learn enormous amount of background knowledge about the world in the early months of life with little supervision and almost no interactions. How can we reproduce this learning paradigm in machines? One proposal for doing so is Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in which a system is trained to predict a part of the input from the rest of the input. SSL, in the form of denoising auto-encoder, has been astonishingly successful for learning task-independent representations of text. But the success has not been translated to images and videos. The main obstacle is how to represent uncertainty in high-dimensional continuous spaces in which probability densities are generally intractable. We propose to use Energy-Based Models (EBM) to represent data manifolds or level-sets of distributions on the variables to be predicted. There are two classes of methods to train EBMs: (1) contrastive methods that push down on the energy of data points and push up elsewhere; (2) architectural and regularizing methods that limit or minimize the volume of space that can take low energies by regularizing the information capacity of a latent variable. While contrastive methods have been somewhat successful to learn image features, they are very expensive computationally. I will propose that the future of self-supervised representation learning lies in regularized latent-variable energy-based models.\"",

J. Hazen, Eneko Agirre, Hinrich Sch\\xc3\\xbctze\\\\n\\\\nWord embeddings typically represent different meanings of a word in a single conflated vector. Empirical analysis of embeddings of ambiguous words is currently limited by the small size of manually annotated resources and by the fact that word senses are treated as unrelated individual concepts. We present a large dataset based on manual Wikipedia annotations and word senses, where word senses from different words are related by semantic classes. This is the basis for novel diagnostic tests for an embedding\\xe2\\x80\\x99s content: we probe word embeddings for semantic classes and analyze the embedding space by classifying embeddings into semantic classes. Our main findings are: (i) Information about a sense is generally represented well in a single-vector embedding \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the sense is frequent. (ii) A classifier can accurately predict whether a word is single-sense or multi-sense, based only on its embedding. (iii) Although rare senses are not well represented in single-vector embeddings, this does not have negative impact on an NLP application whose performance depends on frequent senses.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1574/\"",

Several recent works have shown the feasibility of collapsing the cascade into a single, direct model that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on a corpus of translated speech. However, experiments are inconclusive on whether the cascade or the direct model is stronger, and have only been conducted under the unrealistic assumption that both are trained on equal amounts of data, ignoring other available speech recognition and machine translation corpora. In this paper, we demonstrate that direct speech translation models require more data to perform well than cascaded models, and while they allow including auxiliary data through multi-task training, they are poor at exploiting such data, putting them at a severe disadvantage. As a remedy, we propose the use of end-to-end trainable models with two attention mechanisms, the first establishing source speech to source text alignments, the second modeling source to target text alignment. We show that such models naturally decompose into multi-task-trainable recognition and translation tasks and propose an attention-passing technique that alleviates error propagation issues in a previous formulation of a model with two attention stages. Our proposed model outperforms all examined baselines and is able to exploit auxiliary training data much more effectively than direct attentional models.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/Q19-1020/\"",

In this paper, we explore to which extent the current distributional landscape based on word embeddings provides a suitable basis for classification of collocations, i.e., pairs of words between which idiosyncratic lexical relations hold. First, we introduce a novel dataset with collocations categorized according to lexical functions. Second, we conduct experiments on a subset of this benchmark, comparing it in particular to the well known DiffVec dataset. In these experiments, in addition to simple word vector arithmetic operations, we also investigate the role of unsupervised relation vectors as a complementary input. While these relation vectors indeed help, we also show that lexical function classification poses a greater challenge than the syntactic and semantic relations that are typically used for benchmarks in the literature.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1576/\"",

In this work we evaluate the contribution made by individual attention heads to the overall performance of the model and analyze the roles played by them in the encoder. We find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L0 penalty, we observe that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1580/\"",

In neural machine translation, byte-pair encoding can be used to represent OOVs, but they are still often incorrectly translated. We improve the translation of OOVs in NMT using easy-to-obtain monolingual data. We look for OOVs in the text to be translated and translate them using simple-to-construct bilingual word embeddings (BWEs). In our MT experiments we take the 5-best candidates, which is motivated by intrinsic mining experiments. Using all five of the proposed target language words as queries we mine target-language sentences. We then back-translate, forcing the back-translation of each of the five proposed target-language OOV-translation-candidates to be the original source-language OOV. We show that by using this synthetic data to fine-tune our system the translation of OOVs can be dramatically improved. In our experiments we use a system trained on Europarl and mine sentences containing medical terms from monolingual data.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1581/\"",

Previous work either uses fixed-latency policies, or train a complicated two-staged model using reinforcement learning. We propose a much simpler single model that adds a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d token to the target vocabulary, and design a restricted dynamic oracle to greatly simplify training. Experiments on Chinese English simultaneous translation show that our work leads to flexible policies that achieve better BLEU scores and lower latencies compared to both fixed and RL-learned policies.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1582/\"",

More specifically, we investigate a hypothesis that certain concepts such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9caddiction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbullying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9charassment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprejudice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrauma\\xe2\\x80\\x9d became broader during the last four decades. We evaluate semantic changes using two models: an LSA-based model from Sagi et al. (2009) and a diachronic adaptation of word2vec from Hamilton et al. (2016), that are trained on a large corpus of journal abstracts covering the period of 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x93 2019. Several concepts showed evidence of broadening. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAddiction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moved from physiological dependency on a substance to include psychological dependency on gaming and the Internet. Similarly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9charassment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrauma\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shifted towards more psychological meanings. On the other hand, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbullying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has transformed into a more victim-related concept and expanded to new areas such as workplaces.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4704/\"",

Our methods formally quantify three reflexes of bleaching: decreasing similarity to the source meaning (e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cawful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), increasing similarity to a fully bleached prototype (e.g., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), and increasing productivity (e.g., the breadth of adjectives that an adverb modifies). We also test a new causal model and find evidence that bleaching is initially triggered in contexts such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconspicuously evident\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinsanely jealous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, where an adverb premodifies a semantically similar adjective. These contexts provide a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbridging context\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Evans and Wilkins, 2000) that allow a manner adverb to be reinterpreted as an intensifying adverb similar to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvery\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4701/\"",

The method is used to factor a complex neural model into its functional components, which are comprised of sets of co-firing neurons that cut across layers of the network architecture, and which we call neural pathways. The function of these pathways can be understood by identifying correlated task level and linguistic heuristics in such a way that this knowledge acts as a lens for approximating what the network has learned to apply to its intended task. As a case study for investigating the utility of these pathways, we present an examination of pathways identified in models trained for two standard tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Recognizing Textual Entailment.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1575/\"",

The underlying LDA-based generative model can be extended to refine the representation of a polysemous word in a short context, allowing us to use the embedings in contextual tasks. On computational NLP tasks, Word2Sense embeddings compare well with other word embeddings generated by unsupervised methods. Across tasks such as word similarity, entailment, sense induction, and contextual interpretation, Word2Sense is competitive with the state-of-the-art method for that task. Word2Sense embeddings are at least as sparse and fast to compute as prior art.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1570/\"",

Zico Kolter\\\\n\\\\nAbstract:\\\\nWe cast doubt on the power of uniform convergence-based generalization bounds to provide a complete picture of why overparameterized deep networks generalize well. While it is well-known that many existing bounds are numerically large, through a variety of experiments, we first bring to light another crucial and more concerning aspect of these bounds: in practice, these bounds can {\\\\\\\\em increase} with the dataset size. Guided by our observations, we then present examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where uniform convergence provably cannot `explain generalization,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 even if we take into account implicit regularization {\\\\\\\\em to the fullest extent possible}. More precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by SGD that have test errors less than some small \\xcf\\xb5, applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers yields a generalization guarantee that is larger than 1\\xe2\\x88\\x92\\xcf\\xb5 and is therefore nearly vacuous.\"",

We look at many different ways to implement callbacks in Python, and discuss their pros and cons.

To do so, we first need to learn about *hooks* in PyTorch, which allow us to add callbacks to the forward and backward passes. We will use hooks to track the changing distribution of our activations in each layer during training. By plotting this distributions, we can try to identify  problems with our training.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to fix the problems we see, we try changing our activation function, and introducing batchnorm. We study the pros and cons of batchnorm, and note some areas where it performs poorly. Finally, we develop a new kind of normalization layer to overcome these problems, and compare it to previously published approaches, and see some very encouraging results.\"",

We show that it is possible to study contact-induced language change computationally in a historical variety of a low-resource language, Early-Modern Frisian, by creating a model using features that were established to be relevant in a closely related language, modern Dutch. This allows us to test two hypotheses on two types of language contact that may have taken place between Frisian and Dutch during this time. Our model shows that Frisian verb cluster word orders are associated with different context features than Dutch verb orders, supporting the \\xe2\\x80\\x98learned borrowing\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hypothesis.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4733/\"",

Dennig, Michael Blumenschein, Daniel A. Keim, Miriam Butt\\\\n\\\\nHistorical change typically is the result of complex interactions between several linguistic factors. Identifying the relevant factors and understanding how they interact across the temporal dimension is the core remit of historical linguistics. With respect to corpus work, this entails a separate annotation, extraction and painstaking pair-wise comparison of the relevant bits of information. This paper presents a significant extension of HistoBankVis, a multilayer visualization system which allows a fast and interactive exploration of complex linguistic data. Linguistic factors can be understood as data dimensions which show complex interrelationships. We model these relationships with the Parallel Sets technique. We demonstrate the powerful potential of this technique by applying the system to understanding the interaction of case, grammatical relations and word order in the history of Icelandic.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/W19-4734/\"",

However, it remains a question whether a smart data selection strategy can further improve low-resource NMT with data from other auxiliary languages. In this paper, we seek to construct a sampling distribution over all multilingual data, so that it minimizes the training loss of the low-resource language. Based on this formulation, we propose and efficient algorithm, (TCS), which first samples a target sentence, and then conditionally samples its source sentence. Experiments show TCS brings significant gains of up to 2 BLEU improvements on three of four languages we test, with minimal training overhead.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1583/\"",

Is there any correspondence between hidden layers of these recurrent models and brain regions when processing sentences? Can these deep models be used to synthesize brain data which can then be utilized in other extrinsic tasks? We investigate these questions using sentences with simple syntax and semantics (e.g., The bone was eaten by the dog.). We consider multiple neural network architectures, including recently proposed ELMo and BERT. We use magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain recording data collected from human subjects when they were reading these simple sentences. Overall, we find that BERT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activations correlate the best with MEG brain data. We also find that the deep network representation can be used to generate brain data from new sentences to augment existing brain data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that the MEG brain recording when reading a word in a sentence can be used to distinguish earlier words in the sentence. Our exploration is also the first to use deep neural network representations to generate synthetic brain data and to show that it helps in improving subsequent stimuli decoding task accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nPaper: aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1507/\"",

Developed and studied for decades, recent combinations of RL with modern deep learning have led to impressive demonstrations of the capabilities of today\\'s RL systems, and have fuelled an explosion of interest and research activity. Join this tutorial to learn about the foundations of RL - elegant ideas that give rise to agents that can learn extremely complex behaviors in a wide range of settings. Broadening out, I give a (subjective) overview of where we currently are in terms of what\\'s possible. I conclude with an outlook on key opportunities - both for future research and for real-world applications of RL.\"",

Some are enormously positive, while others, such as the development of autonomous weapons and the replacement of humans in economic roles, may be negative. Beyond these, one must expect that AI capabilities will eventually exceed those of humans across a range of real-world-decision making scenarios. Should this be a cause for concern, as Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and others have suggested? And, if so, what can we do about it? While some in the mainstream AI community dismiss the issue, I will argue that the problem is real and that the technical aspects of it are solvable if we replace current definitions of AI with a version based on provable benefit to humans.\"",

We discuss desired properties for these machine learning markets in terms of fair revenue distribution and potential threats, including data replication. We then instantiate a collaborative market for cases where parties share a common machine learning task and where parties\\' tasks are different. Our marketplace incentivizes parties to submit high quality training and true validation data. To this end, we introduce a novel payment division function that is robust-to-replication and customized output models that perform well only on requested machine learning tasks. In experiments, we validate the assumptions underlying our theoretical analysis and show that these are approximately satisfied for commonly used machine learning models.\"",

Solving these games introduces distinct challenges compared to the standard minimization tasks that the machine learning (ML) community is used to. A symptom of this issue is ML and deep learning (DL) practitioners using optimization tools on game-theoretic problems. Recent work seeks to rectify this situation by bringing game theoretic tools into ML. At NeurIPS 2018 we held \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmooth games optimization in ML\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a workshop with this scope and goal in mind. Last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workshop addressed theoretical aspects of games in machine learning, their special dynamics, and typical challenges. Talks by Costis Daskalakis, Niao He, Jacob Abernethy and Paulina Grnarova emphasized various fundamental topics in a pure, simplified theoretical setting. A number of contributed talks and posters tackled similar questions. The workshop culminated in a panel discussion that identified a number of interesting questions. The aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from the ML, mathematical programming and game theory community to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between smooth games, their applications in ML, as well existing tools and methods for dealing with them. We are looking for contributions that identifies and discusses open, forward-looking problems of interest to the NeurIPS community.\"",

However, fundamentally new ideas in machine learning are needed to translate biomedical data at scale into a mechanistic understanding of biology and disease at a level of abstraction beyond single genes. This challenge has the potential to drive the next decade of creativity in machine learning as the field grapples with how to move beyond prediction to a regime that broadly catalyzes and accelerates scientific discovery.\\\\n\\\\nTo seize this opportunity, we will bring together current and future leaders within each field to introduce the next generation of machine learning specialists to the next generation of biological problems. Our full-day workshop will start a deeper dialogue with the goal of Learning Meaningful Representations of Life (LMRL), emphasizing interpretable representation learning of structure and principles. The workshop will address this challenge at five layers of biological abstraction (genome, molecule, cell, system, phenome) through interactive breakout sessions led by a diverse team of experimentalists and computational scientists to facilitate substantive discussion.\\\\n\\\\nWe are calling for short abstracts from computer scientists and biological scientists. Submission deadline is Friday, September 20. Significant travel support is also available.

This has started to change following recent developments of tools and techniques combining Bayesian approaches with deep learning. The intersection of the two fields has received great interest from the community over the past few years, with the introduction of new deep learning models that take advantage of Bayesian techniques, as well as Bayesian models that incorporate deep learning elements [1-11]. In fact, the use of Bayesian techniques in deep learning can be traced back to the 1990s\\xe2\\x80\\x99, in seminal works by Radford Neal [12], David MacKay [13], and Dayan et al. [14]. These gave us tools to reason about deep models\\xe2\\x80\\x99 confidence, and achieved state-of-the-art performance on many tasks. However earlier tools did not adapt when new needs arose (such as scalability to big data), and were consequently forgotten. Such ideas are now being revisited in light of new advances in the field, yielding many exciting new results.\\\\n\\\\nExtending on last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s workshop\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success, this workshop will again study the advantages and disadvantages of such ideas, and will be a platform to host the recent flourish of ideas using Bayesian approaches in deep learning and using deep learning tools in Bayesian modelling. The program includes a mix of invited talks, contributed talks, and contributed posters. It will be composed of five themes: deep generative models, variational inference using neural network recognition models, practical approximate inference techniques in Bayesian neural networks, applications of Bayesian neural networks, and information theory in deep learning. Future directions for the field will be debated in a panel discussion.\"",

Some of these models are implicit, meaning they generate samples without specifying a probability distribution function (e.g. GANs), and some are explicit, specifying a distribution function \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with a potentially quite complex structure which may not admit efficient sampling or normalization. This tutorial will provide modern nonparametric tools for evaluating and benchmarking both implicit and explicit models. For implicit models, samples from the model are compared with real-world samples; for explicit models, a Stein operator is defined to compare the model to data samples without requiring a normalized probability distribution. In both cases, we also consider relative tests to choose the best of several incorrect models. We will emphasize interpretable tests throughout, where the way in which the model differs from the data is conveyed to the user.\"",

While this is unlocking a wealth of valuable applications, it has not created anything resembling a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, raising interesting new (and, sometimes, old) perspectives on what we really mean when we refer to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgeneral intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in big-brained animals, including ourselves. Public scrutiny has also intensified regarding a host of seemingly unrelated concerns: how can we make fair and ethical models? How can we have privacy in a world where our data are the fuel for training all of these models? Does AI at scale increase or curtail human agency? Will AI help or harm the planet ecologically, given the exponentially increasing computational loads we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started to see? Do we face a real risk of runaway AI without human value alignment? This talk will be technically grounded, but will also address these big questions and some non-obvious interconnections between them. We will begin with privacy and agency in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ML landscape, noting how new technologies for efficient on-device inference and federated computation offer ways to scale beneficial applications without incurring many of the downsides of current mainstream methods. We will then delve deeper into the limitations of the optimization framework for ML, and explore alternative approaches involving meta-learning, evolution strategies, populations, sociality, and cultural accumulation. We hypothesize that this relatively underexplored approach to general intelligence may be both fruitful in the near term and more optimistic in its long-term outlook.\"",

It addresses key considerations in AI regarding when and where data-driven solutions are reliable and appropriate. Such considerations require involvement from humans who collectively understand the domain and tools used to collect, process, and model data. Throughout the data science life cycle, these humans make judgment calls to extract information from data. Veridical data science seeks to ensure that this information is reliable, reproducible, and clearly communicated so that empirical evidence may be evaluated in the context of human decisions. Three core principles: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) provide the foundation for veridical data science. In this talk we will present a unified PCS framework for data analysis, consisting of both a workflow and documentation, illustrated through iterative random forests and case studies from genomics and precision medicine.\"",

Classical approaches are based on a detect-then-describe paradigm where separate handcrafted methods are used to first identify repeatable keypoints and then represent them with a local descriptor. Neural networks trained with metric learning losses have recently caught up with these techniques, focusing on learning repeatable saliency maps for keypoint detection or learning descriptors at the detected keypoint locations. In this work, we argue that repeatable regions are not necessarily discriminative and can therefore lead to select suboptimal keypoints. Furthermore, we claim that descriptors should be learned only in regions for which matching can be performed with high confidence. We thus propose to jointly learn keypoint detection and description together with a predictor of the local descriptor discriminativeness. This allows to avoid ambiguous areas, thus leading to reliable keypoint detection and description. Our detection-and-description approach simultaneously outputs sparse, repeatable and reliable keypoints that outperforms state-of-the-art detectors and descriptors on the HPatches dataset and on the recent Aachen Day-Night localization benchmark.\"",

Inequity and healthcare disparity has long been a concern in clinical and public health for decades. However, the challenges of fair and equitable care using ML in health has largely remained unexplored. While a few works have attempted to highlight potential concerns and pitfalls in recent years, there are massive gaps in academic ML literature in this context. The goal of this workshop is to investigate issues around fairness that are specific to ML based healthcare. We hope to investigate a myriad of questions via the workshop.\"",

Generative models enable new types of media creation across images, music, and text - including recent advances such as StyleGAN, MuseNet and GPT-2. This one-day workshop broadly explores issues in the applications of machine learning to creativity and design. We will look at algorithms for generation and creation of new media, engaging researchers building the next generation of generative models (GANs, RL, etc). We investigate the social and cultural impact of these new models, engaging researchers from HCI/UX communities and those using machine learning to develop new creative tools. In addition to covering the technical advances, we also address the ethical concerns ranging from the use of biased datasets to the use of synthetic media such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeepFakes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Finally, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear from some of the artists and musicians who are adopting machine learning including deep learning and reinforcement learning as part of their own artistic process. We aim to balance the technical issues and challenges of applying the latest generative models to creativity and design with philosophical and cultural issues that surround this area of research.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in advancing art and music generation to present new work, foster collaborations and build networks.\\\\n\\\\nPaper in Sequence:\\\\n1.

It solves a fundamental, and long-standing open problem by deriving an efficient algorithm for learning in this case. This paper makes tremendous progress on a long-standing open problem at the heart of machine learning: efficiently learning half-spaces under Massart noise. To give a simple example highlighted in the paper, even weak learning disjunctions (to error 49%) under 1% Massart noise was open. This paper shows how to efficiently achieve excess risk equal to the Massart noise level plus epsilon (and runs in time poly(1/epsilon), as desired). The algorithmic approach is sophisticated and the results are technically challenging to establish. The final goal is to be able to efficiently get excess risk equal to epsilon (in time poly(1/epsilon)). \\\\n\\\\nPaper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8722-distribution-independent-pac-learning-of-halfspaces-with-massart-noise.pdf\"",

These metric-optimized example weights can be learned for any test metric, including black box and customized ones for specific applications. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method on diverse public benchmark datasets and real-world applications. We also provide a generalization bound for the method.\"",

This approach was strongly inspired by the study of animal behaviour and has led to outstanding achievements in machine learning (e.g. in games, robotics, science). However, artificial agents still struggle with a number of difficulties, such as sample efficiency, learning in dynamic environments and over multiple timescales, generalizing and transferring knowledge. On the other end, biological agents excel at these tasks. The brain has evolved to adapt and learn in dynamic environments, while integrating information and learning on different timescales and for different duration. Animals and humans are able to extract information from the environment in efficient ways by directing their attention and actively choosing what to focus on. They can achieve complicated tasks by solving sub-problems and combining knowledge as well as representing the environment in efficient ways and plan their decisions off-line. Neuroscience and cognitive science research has largely focused on elucidating the workings of these mechanisms. Learning more about the neural and cognitive underpinnings of these functions could be key to developing more intelligent and autonomous agents. Similarly, having a computational and theoretical framework, together with a normative perspective to refer to, could and does contribute to elucidate the mechanisms used by animals and humans to perform these tasks. Building on the connection between biological and artificial reinforcement learning, our workshop will bring together leading and emergent researchers from Neuroscience, Psychology and Machine Learning to share: (i) how neural and cognitive mechanisms can provide insights to tackle challenges in RL research and (ii) how machine learning advances can help further our understanding of the brain and behaviour.\"",

However, for many real applications,the i.i.d. assumption does not hold. We consider learning problems in which examples are dependent and their dependency relation is characterized by a graph.To establish algorithm-dependent generalization theory for learning with non-i.i.d.data, we first prove novel McDiarmid-type concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions of graph-dependent random variables. We show that concentration re-lies on the forest complexity of the graph, which characterizes the strength of the dependency. We demonstrate that for many types of dependent data, the forest complexity is small and thus implies good concentration. Based on our new inequalities we are able to build stability bounds for learning from graph-dependent data.\"",

Recent single-cell profiling technologies are creating a data deluge, wherein thousands of variables are measured for each of hundreds of thousands to millions of cells in a single dataset. The proliferation of single-cell genomic and imaging data is creating opportunities to apply machine learning approaches in order to construct a human cell atlas with enormous potential to uncover new biology\\xe2\\x80\\x94by describing the incredible diversity of our constituent cell populations, how they function, how this diversity emerges from a single cell and how processes go awry in disease. We will present success stories and computational challenges raised by these new data modalities, in both health and disease settings. Examples will include methods from manifold learning, probabilistic graphical models and deep learning.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDana Pe\\'er (Columbia University)\\\\n\\\\nChair of Computational and Systems Biology program, Sloan Kettering Institute and Director of Alan and Sandra Gerry Center for Metastasis and Tumor Ecosystems.

It is clear that combining ideas from the two fields would be beneficial, but how can we achieve this given their fundamental differences?\\\\n\\\\nThis tutorial will introduce modern Bayesian principles to bridge this gap. Using these principles, we can derive a range of learning-algorithms as special cases, e.g., from classical algorithms, such as linear regression and forward-backward algorithms, to modern deep-learning algorithms, such as SGD, RMSprop and Adam. This view then enables new ways to improve aspects of deep learning, e.g., with uncertainty, robustness, and interpretation. It also enables the design of new methods to tackle challenging problems, such as those arising in active learning, continual learning, reinforcement learning, etc.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, our goal is to bring Bayesians and deep-learners closer than ever before, and motivate them to work together to solve challenging real-world problems by combining their strengths.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVideo is reposted for education purpose.\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\nSubscribe \\xe2\\x87\\xa2 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_QLqna7cFtTCfZ0a8pycg?sub_confirmation=1\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"",

The world is a sea of information too vast for any one person to acquire entirely. How then do people navigate the information overload, and how do their decisions shape their knowledge and beliefs? In this talk, Kidd will discuss research from her lab about the core cognitive systems people use to guide their learning about the world\\xe2\\x80\\x94including attention, curiosity, and metacognition (thinking about thinking). The talk will discuss the evidence that people play an active role in their own learning, starting in infancy and continuing through adulthood. Kidd will explain why we are curious about some things but not others, and how our past experiences and existing knowledge shape our future interests. She will also discuss why people sometimes hold beliefs that are inconsistent with evidence available in the world, and how we might leverage our knowledge of human curiosity and learning to design systems that better support access to truth and reality.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVideo is reposted for education purpose.\"",

Such questions have come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper [Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. An attraction of such ideas is that a pure kernel-based method is used to capture the power of a fully-trained deep net of infinite width.\\\\n\\\\nThe current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm for computing the extension of NTK to convolutional neural nets, which we call Convolutional NTK (CNTK), as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than the methods reported in [Novak et al., 2019], and only 5% lower than the performance of the corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization etc. are turned off). Theoretically, we also give the first non-asymptotic proof showing that a fully-trained sufficiently wide net is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using NTK.\"",

Forecasting introduces several challenges such as (i) frequent updates are necessary to deal with concept drift issues since the dynamics of the environment change over time, and (ii) the state of the art models are non-convex models. We address these challenges with a novel regret framework. Standard regret measures commonly do not consider both dynamic environment and non-convex models. We introduce a local regret for non-convex models in a dynamic environment. We present an update rule incurring a cost, according to our proposed local regret, which is sublinear in time T. Our update uses time-smoothed gradients. Using a real-world dataset we show that our time-smoothed approach yields several benefits when compared with state-of-the-art competitors: results are more stable against new data; training is more robust to hyperparameter selection; and our approach is more computationally efficient than the alternatives.\"",

However, these models often fitbehavior more poorly than recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are more flex-ible and make fewer assumptions about the underlying decision-making processes.Unfortunately, the parameter and latent activity spaces of RNNs are generally high-dimensional and uninterpretable, making it hard to use them to study individualdifferences.  Here, we show how to benefit from the flexibility of RNNs whilerepresenting individual differences in a low-dimensional and interpretable space.To achieve this, we propose a novel end-to-end learning framework in which anencoder is trained to map the behavior of subjects into a low-dimensional latentspace. These low-dimensional representations are used to generate the parametersof individual RNNs corresponding to the decision-making process of each subject.We introduce terms into the loss function that ensure that the latent dimensions areinformative and disentangled, i.e., encouraged to have distinct effects on behav-ior. This allows them to align with separate facets of individual differences. Weillustrate the performance of our framework on synthetic data as well as a datasetincluding the behavior of patients with psychiatric disorders.\"",

We develop extensions ofNesterov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dual averaging method, that can exploit the regularization structure in an online setting.At each iteration of these methods, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple mini-mization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss function andthe whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. Inthe case of\\xe2\\x84\\x931-regularization, our methodis particularly effective in obtaining sparse solutions. We show that these methods achieve the op-timal convergence rates or regret bounds that are standard in the literature on stochastic and onlineconvex optimization.  For stochastic learning problems in which the loss functions have Lipschitzcontinuous gradients, we also present an accelerated version of the dual averaging method.\"",

To this end, we introduce a novel visualization algorithm that reveals the internal geometry of such networks: Multislice PHATE (M-PHATE), the first method designed explicitly to visualize how a neural network\\'s hidden representations of data evolve throughout the course of training. We demonstrate that our visualization provides intuitive, detailed summaries of the learning dynamics beyond simple global measures (i.e., validation loss and accuracy), without the need to access validation data. Furthermore, M-PHATE better captures both the dynamics and community structure of the hidden units as compared to visualization based on standard dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., ISOMAP, t-SNE). We demonstrate M-PHATE with two vignettes: continual learning and generalization. In the former, the M-PHATE visualizations display the mechanism of \\\\\"",

While it is well-known that many existing bounds are numerically large, through a variety of experiments, we first bring to light another crucial and more concerning aspect of these bounds: in practice, these bounds can {\\\\\\\\em increase} with the dataset size. Guided by our observations, we then present examples of overparameterized linear classifiers and neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where uniform convergence provably cannot `explain generalization,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 even if we take into account implicit regularization {\\\\\\\\em to the fullest extent possible}. More precisely, even if we consider only the set of classifiers output by SGD that have test errors less than some small \\xcf\\xb5, applying (two-sided) uniform convergence on this set of classifiers yields a generalization guarantee that is larger than 1\\xe2\\x88\\x92\\xcf\\xb5 and is therefore nearly vacuous.\\\\n\\\\nVideo is reposted for educational purpose.\"",

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments.Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers andnonlinear activation functions.  We analyze theoretically the expressiveness ofGCNs, concluding that a modular GCN design, using different propagation ruleswith residual connections could significantly improve the performance of GCN.We demonstrate that such modular designs are capable of distinguishing graphsfrom different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriouslydifficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is muchmore influential than width, with deeper GCNs being more capable of learninghigher order graph moments. Additionally, combining GCN modules with differentpropagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs.\"",

However, if at least one language is morphologically rich, a large number of words can be composed of morphemes from more than one language (intra-word CS). In this paper, we extend the language identification task to the subword-level, such that it includes splitting mixed words while tagging each part with a language ID. We further propose a model for this task, which is based on a segmental recurrent neural network. In experiments on a new Spanish--Wixarika dataset and on an adapted German--Turkish dataset, our proposed model performs slightly better than or roughly on par with our best baseline, respectively. Considering only mixed words, however, it strongly outperforms all baselines.\"",

However, this strong assumption may not capture the semantic association between words that co-occur frequently but non-locally within documents. In this paper, we propose a graph-based word embedding method, named \\xe2\\x80\\x98word-node2vec\\xe2\\x80\\x99. By relaxing the strong constraint of locality, our method is able to capture both the local and non-local co-occurrences. Word-node2vec constructs a graph where every node represents a word and an edge between two nodes represents a combination of both local (e.g. word2vec) and document-level co-occurrences. Our experiments show that word-node2vec outperforms word2vec and glove on a range of different tasks, such as predicting word-pair similarity, word analogy and concept categorization.\"",

We create a small annotated dataset and use it to assess the performance of a standard model for meaning shift detection on short-term meaning shift.

Recently, many methods have made progress on these two tasks. However, few works aim at extracting opinion targets and opinion words as pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence labeling subtask for ABSA named TOWE (Target-oriented Opinion Words Extraction), which aims at extracting the corresponding opinion words for a given opinion target. A target-fused sequence labeling neural network model is designed to perform this task. The opinion target information is well encoded into context by an Inward-Outward LSTM. Then left and right contexts of the opinion target and the global context are combined to find the corresponding opinion words. We build four datasets for TOWE based on several popular ABSA benchmarks from laptop and restaurant reviews. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the other compared methods significantly. We believe that our work may not only be helpful for downstream sentiment analysis task, but can also be used for pair-wise opinion summarization.\"",

Despite the success existing works have\\\\nachieved using a parallel corpus for the two\\\\nstyles, transferring text style has proven significantly more challenging when there is no\\\\nparallel training corpus. In this paper, we address this challenge by using a reinforcementlearning-based generator-evaluator architecture. Our generator employs an attentionbased encoder-decoder to transfer a sentence\\\\nfrom the source style to the target style. Our\\\\nevaluator is an adversarially trained style discriminator with semantic and syntactic constraints that score the generated sentence for\\\\nstyle, meaning preservation, and fluency. Experimental results on two different style transfer tasks (sentiment transfer and formality\\\\ntransfer) show that our model outperforms\\\\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we\\\\nperform a manual evaluation that demonstrates\\\\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method using\\\\nsubjective metrics of generated text quality.\"",

However, recent studies reveal that the lack of recurrence hinders its further improvement of translation capacity (Chen et al., 2018; Dehghani et al., 2019). In response to this\\\\nproblem, we propose to directly model recurrence for Transformer with an additional recurrence encoder. In addition to the standard recurrent neural network, we introduce\\\\na novel attentive recurrent network to leverage the strengths of both attention and recurrent networks. Experimental results on the\\\\nwidely-used WMT14 English\\xe2\\x87\\x92German and\\\\nWMT17 Chinese\\xe2\\x87\\x92English translation tasks\\\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\\\\napproach. Our studies also reveal that the\\\\nproposed model benefits from a short-cut that\\\\nbridges the source and target sequences with\\\\na single recurrent layer, which outperforms its\\\\ndeep counterpart.\"",

Back-translation has been dominantly used in previous approaches for unsupervised neural machine translation, where pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the models with a reconstruction loss. However, the pseudo sentences are usually of low quality as translation errors accumulate during training. To avoid this fundamental issue, we propose an alternative but more effective approach, extract-edit, to extract and then edit real sentences from the target monolingual corpora. Furthermore, we introduce a comparative translation loss to evaluate the translated target sentences and thus train the unsupervised translation systems. Experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art unsupervised machine translation systems across two benchmarks (English-French and English-German) and two low-resource language pairs (English-Romanian and English-Russian) by more than 2 (up to 3.63) BLEU points\\\\n\\\\nProceedings of NAACL-HLT 2019, pages 1173\\xe2\\x80\\x931183\\\\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, June 2 - June 7, 2019. \\\\nc 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics\"",

In this paper, we (1) propose\\\\nan NMT model that can naturally generate the\\\\ntopology of an arbitrary tree structure on the\\\\ntarget side, and (2) experiment with various\\\\ntarget tree structures. Our experiments show\\\\nthe surprising result that our model delivers the\\\\nbest improvements with balanced binary trees\\\\nconstructed without any linguistic knowledge;\\\\nthis model outperforms standard seq2seq models by up to 2.1 BLEU points, and other methods for incorporating target-side syntax by up\\\\nto 0.7 BLEU.\"",

As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these\\\\ncounterintuitive results, we draw connections\\\\nto adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with\\\\nmaximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples.\\\\nFine-tuned models become more interpretable\\\\nunder input reduction without accuracy loss on\\\\nregular examples.\"",

In addition,\\\\niterative backtranslation improves results further, yielding, for instance, 14.08 and 26.22\\\\nBLEU points in WMT 2014 English-German\\\\nand English-French, respectively, an improvement of more than 7-10 BLEU points over previous unsupervised systems, and closing the\\\\ngap with supervised SMT (Moses trained on\\\\nEuroparl) down to 2-5 BLEU points\"",

In this paper, we investigate the role\\\\nof linguistic features in building more generalizable coreference resolvers. We show\\\\nthat generalization improves only slightly by\\\\nmerely using a set of additional linguistic features. However, employing features and subsets of their values that are informative for\\\\ncoreference resolution, considerably improves\\\\ngeneralization. Thanks to better generalization, our system achieves state-of-the-art results in out-of-domain evaluations, e.g., on\\\\nWikiCoref, our system, which is trained on\\\\nCoNLL, achieves on-par performance with a\\\\nsystem designed for this dataset.\"",

Have you recently been intrigued by the hype of deep learning? Do you want to get your hands dirty? This talk is for you! I will teach you the basic ideas of NLP, basic building blocks of deep learning, and how to assemble them into a piece of workable code in Python.\\\\nDescription: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a challenging subfield of Artificial Intelligence, in which human\\'s ability to understand and produce language is imitated. With the advent of deep learning in mid-2000s, many NLP tasks previously done in traditional statistical methods have gained significant accuracy improvement, thanks to its powerful feature extraction.\\\\nThis talk will go into the basic ideas of natural language processing, some building blocks of neural networks for deep learning, and how to assemble them into a piece of runnable code for various NLP tasks. PyTorch will be used as the main gear, because we can easily cope with both static and dynamic network architectures while maintaining the code readability. The speaker kindly assumes the audience to have some knowledge in Python (intermediate: especially classes and objects), university calculus (basic), and linguistics (very basic).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nBio:\\\\nPrachya Boonkwan is a computational linguist and a computer scientist with 16-years experience in natural language processing using Python. He received B.Eng. (honors) and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Engineering from Kasetsart University in 2002 and 2005, respectively. He received a Ph.D. degree in Informatics (specializing in natural language processing) from the University of Edinburgh, UK, in 2014. Since 2005, he has been working as a researcher for Language and Semantic Technology Lab at NECTEC, Thailand. His topics of interest include: grammar induction, statistical parsing, statistical machine translation, natural language processing, machine learning, and formal syntax.\"",

This is most famously used in the *resnet*, which is the architecture we\\'ve used throughout this course for image classification, and appears in many cutting edge results. We\\'ll also look at the *U-net* architecture, which uses a different type of skip connection to greatly improve segmentation results (and also for similar tasks where the output structure is similar to the input).\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ll then use the U-net architecture to train a *super-resolution* model. This is a model which can increase the resolution of a low-quality image. Our model won\\'t only increase resolution--it will also remove jpeg artifacts, and remove unwanted text watermarks.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to make our model produce high quality results, we will need to create a custom loss function which incorporates *feature loss* (also known as *perceptual loss*), along with *gram loss*. These techniques can be used for many other types of image generation task, such as image colorization.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, we\\'ll learn about a recent loss function known as *generative adversarial* loss (used in generative adversarial networks, or *GANs*), which can improve the quality of generative models in some contexts, at the cost of speed.\\\\n\\\\nThe techniques we show in this lesson include some unpublished research that:\\\\n- Let us train GANs more quickly and reliably than standard approaches, by leveraging transfer learning\\\\n- Combines architectural innovations and loss function approaches that haven\\'t been used in this way before.\\\\n\\\\nThe results are stunning, and train in just a couple of hours (compared to previous approaches that take a couple of days).\"",

Since youtube is removing annotations, we are keeping updated information on that site. If you have any questions or need help at any point, please ask at http://forums.fast.ai , where thousands of students are helping each other with this course.\\\\n\\\\nBefore you can start with the first full lesson, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need a deep learning capable machine (that is, a computer with an Nvidia GPU in it) that you can use. For this course, most of the information we provide assumes that you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) for this. To make it as easy as possible for you to get started with AWS, we have provided scripts that automate most of the process of setting up your AWS deep learning server.\\\\n\\\\nThis video shows all the steps necessary to set up your deep learning server, using a recently released AWS product called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cP2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which has a powerful GPU with a lot of memory. It costs $0.90 per hour to run. The linked resources on the left provide more information about how and why to set this up. Remember, if you get stuck, search the forum (using the link on the left), and ask any questions you have there if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find an answer.\\\\n\\\\nThis video, and most of our documentation, use the AWS region us-west-2 (Oregon) as the default. If you are based in Europe, you will want to use eu-east-1 (Ireland) instead and to use setup_p2_ireland.sh instead of setup_p2.sh. Currently, the AWS p2 is only offered in 3 regions. If you are living outside of the US or Europe, you can still use an AMI in one of these regions but may experience higher latency.\\\\n\\\\nNB: AWS needs to verify that new accounts are not fraudulent, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to make a special request for P2 access if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a new AWS customer. The video shows how to make this request, but please note that there has been a change: you can now request P2 instances directly in the form, whereas when this video was created P2 instances were too new and were not listed; also, be sure to use the \\xe2\\x80\\x98use case description\\xe2\\x80\\x99 listed in the video.

That is: each satellite image can contain *multiple* labels, whereas previous datasets we\\'ve looked at have had exactly one label per image. We\\'ll look at what changes we need to make to work with multi-label datasets.\\\\n\\\\nNext, we will look at *image segmentation*, which is the process of labeling every pixel in an image with a category that shows what kind of object is portrayed by that pixel. We will use similar techniques to the earlier image classification models, with a few tweaks. fastai makes image segmentation modeling and interpretation just as easy as image classification, so there won\\'t be too many tweaks required.\\\\n\\\\nWe will be using the popular Camvid dataset for this part of the lesson. In future lessons, we will come back to it and show a few extra tricks. Our final Camvid model will have dramatically lower error than an model we\\'ve been able to find in the academic literature!\\\\n\\\\nWhat if your dependent variable is a continuous value, instead of a category?

The key to this success is the use of *transfer learning*, which will be a key platform for much of this course. We\\'ll also see how to analyze the model to understand its failure modes. In this case, we\\'ll see that the places where the model is making mistakes is in the same areas that even breeding experts can make mistakes.\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ll discuss the overall approach of the course, which is somewhat unusual in being *top-down* rather than *bottom-up*. So rather than starting with theory, and only getting to practical applications later, instead we start with practical applications, and then gradually dig deeper and deeper in to them, learning the theory as needed. This approach takes more work for teachers to develop, but it\\'s been shown to help students a lot, for example in education research at Harvard (https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/0...) by David Perkins.\\\\n\\\\nWe also discuss how to set the most important *hyper-parameter* when training neural networks: the *learning rate*, using Leslie Smith\\'s fantastic *learning rate finder* method. Finally, we\\'ll look at the important but rarely discussed topic of *labeling*, and learn about some of the features that fastai provides for allowing you to easily add labels to your images.\\\\n\\\\nNote that to follow along with the lessons, you\\'ll need to connect to a cloud GPU provider which has the fastai library installed (recommended; it should take only 5 minutes or so, and cost under $0.50/hour), or set up a computer with a suitable GPU yourself (which can take days to get working if you\\'re not familiar with the process, so we don\\'t recommend it). You\\'ll also need to be familiar with the basics of the *Jupyter Notebook* environment we use for running deep learning experiments. Up to date tutorials and recommendations for these are available from the course website (http://course.fast.ai).\"",

However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights\\' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used L2 batch-norm, using normalization in L1 and L\\xe2\\x88\\x9e spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\"",

The technology has grown to be the most talked-about and least well-understood branch of machine learning. Aside from it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highly publicized victories in playing Go, numerous successful applications of deep learning in image and speech recognition has kickstarted movements to integrate it into critical fields like medical imaging and self-driving cars. In the security field, deep learning has shown good experimental results in malware/anomaly detection, APT protection, spam/phishing detection, and traffic identification. This DEF CON 101 session will guide the audience through the theory and motivations behind deep learning systems. We look at the simplest form of neural networks, then explore how variations such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can be used to solve real problems with an unreasonable effectiveness. Then, we demonstrate that most deep learning systems are not designed with security and resiliency in mind, and can be duped by any patient attacker with a good understanding of the system. The efficacy of applications using machine learning should not only be measured with precision and recall, but also by their malleability in an adversarial setting. After diving into popular deep learning software, we show how it can be tampered with to do what you want it do, while avoiding detection by system administrators.\\\\n\\\\nBesides giving a technical demonstration of deep learning and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting, we will focus on tampering real systems to show weaknesses in critical systems built with it. In particular, this demo-driven session will be focused on manipulating an image recognition system built with deep learning at the core, and exploring the difficulties in attacking systems in the wild. We will introduce a tool that helps deep learning hackers generate adversarial content for arbitrary machine learning systems, which can help make models more robust. By discussing defensive measures that should be put in place to prevent the class of attacks demonstrated, we hope to address the hype behind deep learning from the context of security, and look towards a more resilient future of the technology where developers can use it safely in critical deployments.\\\\n\\\\nBio:\\\\nClarence Chio graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Stanford, specializing in data mining and artificial intelligence. He currently works as a Security Research Engineer at Shape Security, building a product that protects high valued web assets from automated attacks. At Shape, he works on the data analysis systems used to tackle this problem. Clarence spoke on Machine Learning and Security at PHDays, BSides Las Vegas and NYC, Code Blue, SecTor, and Hack in Paris. He had been a community speaker with Intel, and is also the founder and organizer of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Data Mining for Cyber Security\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meet up group, the largest gathering of security data scientists in the San Francisco Bay Area.\"",

We\\'ll look at examples of coding projects, how it can relate to other subjects in the curriculum (such as maths and design), and discuss why this is a great tool for introducing beginners to text-based coding.\\\\n\\\\nNo prior knowledge required, although some familiarity with the Minecraft game and/ or text-based coding will be useful.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended for teachers or parents of students in Years 5 - 12 who are at a beginner or intermediate stage of learning programming.

The problem of locating contours arises in many applications, including classification, constrained optimization, and performance analysis of mechanical and dynamical systems (reliability, probability of failure, stability, etc.). Our algorithm locates contours using information from multiple sources, which are available in the form of relatively inexpensive, biased, and possibly noisy approximations to the original function. Considering multiple information sources can lead to significant cost savings. We also introduce the concept of contour entropy, a formal measure of uncertainty about the location of the zero contour of a function approximated by a statistical surrogate model. Our algorithm locates contours efficiently by maximizing the reduction of contour entropy per unit cost.\"",

A critical target scenario is high-throughput screening for scientific discovery, such as drug or materials discovery. In these settings, specialized instruments can often evaluate \\\\\\\\emph{multiple} points simultaneously; however, all existing work on active search focuses on sequential acquisition. We bridge this gap, addressing batch active search from both the theoretical and practical perspective. We first derive the Bayesian optimal policy for this problem, then prove a lower bound on the performance gap between sequential and batch optimal policies: the cost of parallelization.\\'\\' We also propose novel, efficient batch policies inspired by state-of-the-art sequential policies, and develop an aggressive pruning technique that can dramatically speed up computation. We conduct thorough experiments on data from three application domains: a citation network, material science, and drug discovery, testing all proposed policies (14 total) with a wide range of batch sizes. Our results demonstrate that the empirical performance gap matches our theoretical bound, that nonmyopic policies usually significantly outperform myopic alternatives, and that diversity is an important consideration for batch policy design.\"",

Recent progress in the field has yielded optimal convergence rates and algorithms for optimizing smooth and strongly convex functions in such networks. In their award-winning paper, Lee and his co-authors extend the same theoretical analysis to solve an even thornier problem: how to optimize these trade-offs for non-smooth convex functions.\\\\n\\\\nBased on its analysis, the team produced the first optimal algorithm for non-smooth decentralized optimization in the setting where the slope of each function is uniformly bounded. Referred to as multi-step primal dual (MSPD), the algorithm surpasses the previous state-of-the-art technique \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the primal-dual algorithm \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that offered fast communication rates in a decentralized and stochastic setting but without achieving optimality. Under the more challenging global regularity assumption, the researchers present a simple yet efficient algorithm known as distributed randomized smoothing (DRS) that adapts the existing randomized smoothing optimization algorithm for application in the distributed setting. DRS achieves a near-optimal convergence rate and communication cost.\\\\n\\\\nLee contributed to this work in his capacity as a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research and a faculty member at the Allen School. His collaborators include lead author Kevin Scaman, a research scientist at Huawei Technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Paris-based machine learning lab; Microsoft senior researcher S\\xc3\\xa9bastien Bubeck; and researchers Francis Bach and Laurent Massouli\\xc3\\xa9 of Inria, the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. Members of the team will present the paper later today at the NeurIPS conference taking place this week in Montreal, Canada.\"",

Delusional bias arises when the approximation architecture limits the class of expressible greedy policies. Since standard Q-updates make globally uncoordinated action choices with respect to the expressible policy class, inconsistent or even conflicting Q-value estimates can result, leading to pathological behaviour such as over/under-estimation, instability and even divergence. To solve this problem, we introduce a new notion of policy consistency and define a local backup process that ensures global consistency through the use of information sets---sets that record constraints on policies consistent with backed-up Q-values. We prove that both the model-based and model-free algorithms using this backup remove delusional bias, yielding the first known algorithms that guarantee optimal results under general conditions. These algorithms furthermore only require polynomially many information sets (from a potentially exponential support). Finally, we suggest other practical heuristics for value-iteration and Q-learning that attempt to reduce delusional bias.\\\\n\\\\nQ-Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning\"",
