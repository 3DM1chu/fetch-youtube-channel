People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.\\\\n\\\\nCheck out my other playlists:\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Complete Python Programming: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJaY8YuDJniDw-naFVMac-3k\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba 100 Days of  Machine Learning playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJY0Zh22f4n_sOvhObBaY1yL\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Statistics For Machine Learning: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJbmCcNrXYvR4ogG1IYnqdZr\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Object Detection Using YOLO v6: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJY3H0WZGY2XKvuFdvkJS9oM\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Object Detection Using YOLO v7: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJagh6O2MIrgI-Ki-t1rhjLI\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Sign Language Detection Using YOLO v5:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJYWpwFbU8fyaBSwihoVHiJz\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xbaONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJZJx9sQJCyFZt50S4ji1PeR\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x80Please donate if you want to support the channel through Buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dswithbappy\\\\n\\\\nThis channel focuses on providing content on Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, etc. in Bangla and English.  \\\\n\\\\nMy mission is to provide inspiration, motivation \\\\u0026 good quality education to students for learning and human development, and to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, and so on.\\\\n\\\\n #dswithbappy aims to change this education system of Bangladesh. \\\\nI believe that high-quality education is not just for the privileged few.

People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.\\\\n\\\\nThe purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.\\\\n\\\\nAbout this project:\\\\nThis is a streamlit web application that can recommend various kinds of similar movies based on an user interest\\\\n\\\\nCheck out my other playlists:\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Complete Python Programming: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJaY8YuDJniDw-naFVMac-3k\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba 100 Days of  Machine Learning playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJY0Zh22f4n_sOvhObBaY1yL\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Statistics For Machine Learning: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJbmCcNrXYvR4ogG1IYnqdZr\\\\n\\\\nThis channel focuses on providing content on Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, etc. in Bangla and English.  \\\\n\\\\nMy mission is to provide inspiration, motivation \\\\u0026 good quality education to students for learning and human development, and to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, and so on.\\\\n\\\\n #dswithbappy aims to change this education system of Bangladesh. \\\\nI believe that high-quality education is not just for the privileged few.

It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation of images classification. You can classify any image with any classification model in Keras appliaction without writing any lines of code.\\\\n\\\\nImageSeeker is:\\\\n\\\\nSimple -- ImageSeeker reduces developer time of writing too much code of any image classification problem so that they focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.\\\\nFlexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why ImageSeeker is Flexible.\\\\nPowerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: so we can use ImageSeeker in the production\\\\n\\\\nCheck out my other playlists:\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Complete Python Programming: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJaY8YuDJniDw-naFVMac-3k\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba 100 Days of  Machine Learning playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJY0Zh22f4n_sOvhObBaY1yL\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xba Statistics For Machine Learning: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkz_y24mlSJbmCcNrXYvR4ogG1IYnqdZr\\\\n\\\\nThis channel focuses on providing content on Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, etc. in Bangla and English.  \\\\n\\\\nMy mission is to provide inspiration, motivation \\\\u0026 good quality education to students for learning and human development, and to become an expert in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Python programming, and so on.\\\\n\\\\n #dswithbappy aims to change this education system of Bangladesh. \\\\nI believe that high-quality education is not just for the privileged few.
