This collection has been developed through a collaboration of Hugging Face and other contributors, with an emphasis on open-source code modeling. In particular, the base models have been trained with 15 billion parameters and for a trillion tokens. A distinctive feature of StarCoder is its ability to generate continuous code and also fill in gaps in existing code, which I discuss in more detail later.\\\\n\\\\nAs I dive deeper into the models, I explore the applications of StarCoder, including a VS code plugin, which enables the model to operate in a similar fashion to Copilot, and a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) - a highly useful tool for businesses that need to filter sensitive data from documents. I also delve into the different versions of the model, such as the base model and StarCoder StarChat Alpha, a fine-tuned version of the base model that\\'s more adept at text generation. One highlight is the model\\'s impressive sequence length of 8,000 tokens, rivaling GPT-4\\'s base model.\\\\n\\\\n00:00 Intro\\\\n00:27 StarCoder Blog\\\\n02:52 Tech Assistant Prompt\\\\n05:00 Different Models\\\\n07:53 StarCoder Space: Code Completion Playground\\\\n09:13 StarChatAlpha\\\\n12:16 Code Time: StarChatAlpha Running Locally\"",
