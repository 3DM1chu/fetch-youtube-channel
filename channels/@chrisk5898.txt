    "desc": "I started this project realizing, that I\\'ve really created a lot of 3D-Models concerning sci-fi and Star Wars.\\\\nSo why not make a small Unity project with all of these assets, to showcase them.\\\\nAs you can see this escalated a little bit.....\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI wanted to do the whole project by myself, so all 3D-Assets are modeled and animated (sorry I\\'m not a good animator) by me in Blender, except the human heads were generated with MakeHumans (http://www.makehumancommunity.org).\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all of my assets are available on:\\\\nhttps://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Artists/chrikre?referral=chrikre\\\\nhttps://www.cgtrader.com/chrikre\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI love programming and it was a pleasure doing all the game logics\\\\n\\\\n-Projecural Terrain\\\\n-Custom CharackterController\\\\n-Human AI for civilian, enemy with gun, enemy with saber\\\\n-Item pickup system\\\\n-Weapon system for gun and lightsaber combat\\\\n-Vehicle system (for podracer)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Secne is using Unity\\'s HDRP(2020.2.0b9) and is running at about 37fps in 1080p.\\\\nCPU: Ryzen 5 2600x\\\\nGPU: R9 390\\\\nRAM: 16GB\\\\n\\\\nHowever the video was created with Unity\\'s in engine recorder. I wanted 4k 30fps, so while recording my poor old gpu was running this in slowmotion. For this reason the mouse movement is a bit jittery.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe project is still a work in progress. Check out my channel for updates.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso thanks to https://freesound.org for providing all the audio clips.\"",
