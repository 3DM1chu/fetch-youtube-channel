In this video, Daniel Bourke shows you a healthy meal you can cook during your study breaks.\\\\n\\\\nIngredients:\\\\n- 4 Eggs\\\\n- 1/2 Avocado\\\\n- Handful asparagus\\\\n- A few kale leaves\\\\n- 1 onion\\\\n- 1 stalk of shallots\\\\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\\\\n- 3 large mushrooms (6 if smaller)\\\\n- Salt\\\\n- Pepper\\\\n- Seasoning of your choice\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\n1. Heat up 2 pans to 6/10 heat, add at least 1 tablespoon of olive oil to each.\\\\n2. Cut up mushrooms, shallots, onion, remove ends of asparagus.\\\\n3. Add chopped vegetables to 1 pan and crack eggs into another pan.\\\\n4. Add spices to the pan with vegetables (I used dukkah) and mix often.\\\\n5. When vegetables have cooked a little, add kale leaves and mix some more.\\\\n6. Once cooked to satisfaction, move eggs and vegetables to one plate, add avocado and season with salt and pepper.\\\\n7. Enjoy the brain gains!\\\\n\\\\nA great book for foods for brain health (Genius Foods) - https://amzn.to/2MTGCmW\\\\n\\\\nOther tips for eating healthy and optimizing mental performance:\\\\n\\\\n1. Learn to cook - Learning to cook ensures you know what food you\\'re putting in your body. When you eat out you can never be sure of the different ingredients which are being used. If you\\'re looking to improve your health, mental performance or physical performance, start figuring out what foods suit you best by learning to make them yourself.\\\\n\\\\n2. Eat less often - 1-3 meals max per day. You want to reduce the number of times you spike insulin in your body. Insulin is a growth hormone. It triggers your body to store excess energy from food (as fat).\\\\n\\\\n3. Stick to simple foods - The fewer steps a piece of food takes to get to you the better. You want to avoid things which have been overprocessed. If it comes in a packet or requires an advertisement, you don\\'t need it. If you do eat food from a packet, read the ingredients label, if you can\\'t understand the name of something, avoid it. Avoid any kind of added sugar, it\\'s never needed.\\\\n\\\\n4. Avoid seed and vegetable oils - Oils like sunflower, canola and vegetable oils are high in Omega 6\\'s. Too many of these throw your body and brain out of balance (you want to consume equal Omega 6 and Omega 3). Omega 6\\'s and Omega 3\\'s are known as essential fatty acids. Being out of balance of these can lead to problems like lack of concentration, brain fog and more.\\\\n\\\\nBlog post version of this video (ingredients/instructions) - https://dbourke.link/eggsandgreens\\\\n\\\\nMy favourite ML/AI resources - https://bit.ly/AIMLresources\\\\nGet email updates on my work - https://dbourke.link/newsletter\\\\nSupport on Patreon - https://bit.ly/mrdbourkepatreon\\\\n\\\\nConnect elsewhere:\\\\nWeb - https://dbourke.link/web\\\\nQuora - https://dbourke.link/quora\\\\nMedium - https://dbourke.link/medium\\\\nTwitter - https://dbourke.link/twitter\\\\nLinkedIn - https://dbourke.link/linkedin\"",

Set the system up so you always win \\xe2\\x80\\x94 focus on what you can control not what you can\\' control.\\\\n21:17 - 4. Sometimes do nothing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 study like an athlete, intense sessions, then rest.\\\\n26:16 - 5. Embrace the suck \\xe2\\x80\\x94 studying is hard, learning something new is hard. It will take time. 99% of your effort will be wasted. Remind yourself of this. Embrace it.\\\\n30:14 - 6. The 3-year-old mentality \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what if you treated everything as play?

It\\'s what turns your short-term memories into long-term memories.\\\\n37:11 - 8. Nutrition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 food is fuel. If you want to study well, eat well.

This is a good thing because of the scalability of software but it means not all features or fixes can be added to the library as fast as you need them.\\\\n\\\\nBy contributing to an open source library you\\'re helping not only the maintainers of the library but the people who use it in the future. Contributing to open source via a pull request is also something you can add to your portfolio to show what you\\'ve worked on.\\\\n\\\\nHow do you make a pull request?\\\\n\\\\n1. Find an open source repository on GitHub which needs help or start with one you\\'ve been using.\\\\n2. Make a copy of the repository by forking the repository to your own GitHub.\\\\n3. Clone your version of the repository to your local machine: git clone repo-address\\\\n4. Change into the folder you just cloned: cd cloned-folder-name\\\\n5. Create a new branch in your local copy: git checkout -b new-branch-name\\\\n6. Make your edits (these could be adding features or fixing code or correcting spelling).\\\\n7. Add your changes: git add your-file-with-changes\\\\n8. Commit your changes: git commit -m \\\\\"",

No caffeine after 2 p.m.\\\\n2. Minimal screen time at least 1 hour before bed (more is better).\\\\n3. Complete darkness in your bedroom, if it emits light, cover it. \\\\n4. Ensure magnesium intake is adequate (400mg for me, 320mg for women, daily).\\\\n5. Get more natural sunlight throughout the day. \\\\n6. Track your sleep and notice the trends. \\\\n7.
