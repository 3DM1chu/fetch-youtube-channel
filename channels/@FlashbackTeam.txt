Then, we send a phishing email to the device administrator. Once the device administrator clicks on the email link, he will be sent to the device page that contains our XSS payload. That payload sends a malicious request to a REST endpoint in the device that performs the Java deserialization, and we then get our shell running as the web server user. Finally we abuse the incorrect file permissions to get root!\\\\n\\\\nFor an in depth look on each vulnerability and how the exploit works under the hood, please check the advisory at https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/Cisco/cisco_ise_rce.md\\\\n\\\\nCVE-2018-15440: Stored Cross-site Scripting\\\\nCVE-2017-5641: Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization\\\\nSSD-3778: Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo and File Permission\\\\n\\\\nDid you enjoy this video?
