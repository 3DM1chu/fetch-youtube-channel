With so many different light objects and an infinite amount of configurations, it\\'s helpful to have some guiding principles to make the process not only easier, but effective. Today we\\'re going to dive into my favorite lighting trick that applies not only to 3d animation, modeling, and animation but also to general filmmaking and photography. It\\'s one of the most popular lighting tricks used and I think it will forever change how you think about lighting your scenes.

We\\'ve seen the motion design and motion graphics community integrating 3D animations thanks to free tools like Blender, and improvements in real-time rendering in Unreal Engine. As well as animators exploring claymation shaders, grain and noise textures, combined with powerful restricted color palettes. There\\'s a lot to learn from the techniques being employed and what it has to say about our community, as well as what we can expect plenty of clients to be requesting time and time again.

If you\\'re a beginner, using Adobe After Effects to start creating VFX can be a challenge when there are so many cool things to do and try out! Today we\\'re going over the basics of After Effects visual effects with a technique that has lasted me over the course of my career as a VFX Artist and motion designer. Today we\\'re diving into the Teleportation effect! It\\'s an effect that gets used time and time again in countless Hollywood movies, short films, and music videos! It might be worth noting that using vfx elements will save you a bunch of time, but even if you don\\'t have a huge budget, don\\'t worry because there\\'s plenty online for free! We\\'ll be going over the UI of After Effects, shooting a VFX scene properly, what to do when things go wrong, how to import presets, and various VFX elements that range from super affordable to mad expensive so you can be the judge.

When it comes to animating electric effects in After Effects, I know it can be daunting since the possibilities are endless.

GoPro has been plagued with issues since their first edition, and 9 versions later some of these problems have been fixed, though unfortunately replaced with others. Can you pick between a laggy display, or super jittery image? Surprisingly the answer is pretty clear when looking at the design, experience, and additional features this GoPro has to offer. With the Max Lens mod, it\\'s honestly a whole nother beast. The stabilization is taken to the next level. Even a motorized gimbal doesn\\'t compare to the experience of flipping around your camera a full 360 degrees while it maintains a steady horizon line. Atleast for me. I prefer the ease of use, sometimes better low light performance (though still pretty trash), and smoother stabilization on this GoPro vs. others.  And YES I know that the GoPro Hero 10, and Max have been released, but surprisingly this GoPro outperforms the others for the price. The 4k 60fps compares pretty close to the 5k, the slow motion is sometimes sharper, and overall the hypersmooth 3.0 makes for a more even image than hypersmooth 4.0.  Weird. Anyways, the GoPro Hero 9 Black is by no means the perfect camera, but it might just be the best bang for buck available today. \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\x92 GoPro Hero 9 Black:\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3DHJkVs\\\\n\\\\nGoPro Max Lens Mod:\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3v8YW0Z\\\\n\\\\n#BLACKMIXTURE #BLVCKMXTR\\\\nVisit our website https://www.blackmixture.com to learn more about us.\\\\n------------------------------------\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\xb3\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbe Hit me up on Instagram: http://instagram.com/blackmixture\\\\nDrop a like on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/blackmixturellc\\\\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/blackmixtureatl\\\\n\\\\nIf you like what we\\'re doing and want to support:\\\\nhttps://www.paypal.me/BlackMixture\\\\n\\\\nSupport us on Patreon:\\\\nhttps://www.patreon.com/BlackMixture\\\\n\\\\nGod bless and have a wonderful day! \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x97\\\\nMADE FOR MAKERS WITH LOVE \\xe2\\x9d\\xa4\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\"",

That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about making kinetic typography for trailers, lyrics videos, and more! The animation techniques in this video uses mattes, keyframes, and the animation graph editor which comes in handy when animating reveals for logos, titles, and various motion graphic elements. As a motion designer, I\\'ve been asked countless times to create a text animation, so I figured this would be a perfect skill to introduce to After Effects beginners. Not only that, but over the years I\\'ve picked up ways to save a whole bunch of time and effort, so even the AE vets can stick around to learn a thing or two. When it comes to text in After Effects, I know it can be daunting since the possibilities are endless. Don\\'t worry because we\\'ll go over everything from changing the character styles, making a new project, setting up your composition, using alpha mattes, null objects, the horizontal text tool,  and much more in this tutorial! I\\'ll show you how to create text reveal effects without plugins and whole lotta pop! Hope you all enjoy and as a challenge to all the learners, we want to see your animated text so be sure to tag us on Instagram @blackmixture so we can check it out! \\\\n\\\\nBefore you get creating in AE, make sure you hit the subscribe button because I may go over helpful tips and tricks in a future tutorial.

Especially for the creatives that have built a massive audience on a platform that has been illegally mining data and could potentially have Chinese surveillance software. Well today we are going over some of the most recent headlines like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTikTok\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Future or Lack Thereof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShould the US Ban TikTok\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTikTok\\xe2\\x80\\x99s India Ban Hurts Content Creators\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and a bunch of others that (spoiler alert) make TikTok not only the fastest growing app of 2020, but also the most controversial. Many content creators are worried their following may disappear overnight, which as tragic as that sounds, is really just the beginning of the sketchy business with TikTok. Stick around because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go over everything you need to know about TikTok, their ties to the Chinese government, their recent India Ban, their insane censorship policies, and much, much more. Hopefully you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have your questions answered and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have the insight you need to build a sustainable and organic following on a platform that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t screw you later.

Especially when there\\'s a bunch of alternatives such as free online video tutorials like the ones on our channel, or paid online courses from Lynda, Skillshare, or School of Motion. I remember as an aspiring video editor, animator, and motion designer, I really wished someone just sat me down and told me all about the various ways I could go about becoming what I wanted to be. Even if that meant finding out there\\'s a million things I didn\\'t know about animation, video, and art in general.

    "desc": "I hope you\\'re ready for another dope motion graphics tutorial! This week we\\'re going over a super smooth, useful, and popular text animation effect in After Effects! That\\'s right, I\\'m talking about the text write-on effect! This animation technique uses masks to mimics the natural motion of handwriting words which can come in handy when animating reveals for logos, titles, and various motion graphic elements. As a motion designer, I\\'ve been asked countless times to do the text write-on effect, so I figured this would be a perfect skill to introduce to After Effects beginners. Not only that, but over the years I\\'ve picked up ways to save a whole bunch of time and effort, so even the AE vets can stick around to learn a thing or two. When it comes to text in After Effects, I know it can be daunting since the possibilities are endless. Don\\'t worry because we\\'ll go over everything from finding a font, making a new project, setting up your composition, using the pen tool, strokes, light sweeps,  and much more in this tutorial! I\\'ll show you how to create text writing on effects without plugins, and show you my favorite elements pack for really taking it to the next level. Hope you all enjoy and as a challenge to all the learners, we want to see your animated quotes so be sure to tag us on Instagram @blackmixture so we can check it out! \\\\n\\\\nBefore you get creating in AE, make sure you hit the subscribe button because I may go over helpful tips and tricks in a future tutorial.

When I first heard about expressions, I was trying to create a cool effect that I knew existed in Final Cut Pro, but years later I can say expressions are way more useful than just making cool effects. Using the right expression, in the right workflow can drastically improve your results. Whether that\\'s an ease on an animation or a huge timesaving duplicator. I know starting expressions can be daunting and the thought of coding animations can be tricky. As if After Effects wasn\\'t already a lot to begin with. But don\\'t worry because we\\'re kicking off this intro to expressions by going over the most useful ones that are also easy to learn.

Her reaction was priceless. \\\\n\\\\nSo the plan was to propose to Chriselle at Alpharetta High School (the high school where we met), but I wanted it to be extra special, sentimental, and a huge surprise! I reached out to my high school video teacher almost a month ago asking if it was possible to play a video on the Jumbotron...he responded back saying it was MORE than possible and that we could ever have it during halftime of one of the most packed football games of the year (senior night)\\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\xb1. Yea I got instantly nervous but then he added we could coordinate with the marching band, and have the audience help, and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. After confirming the date, I checked the weather almost every day, only to see that the proposal date had a 90% chance of thunderstorms. Fast forward a month later and here it is!\\\\n\\\\nThanks to everyone that put their love and energy into making this marriage proposal possible. I\\'m still processing all that happened.

Sure everyone has heard of Thanos, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Spiderman, Captain America, and even Drax. But have you heard of Weta Digital, Scanline, Vray, or ILM? There are so many vfx shots throughout the series (26,000+) that Marvel had to enlist a bunch studios with talented artists to make some of the most convincing visual effects this decade has seen. By using moven suits, motion capture, machine learning,  and custom built vfx software, the visual effect studios involved throughout the series were able to make jaw dropping visuals and a unique, revolutionary production style. When you take a look at the breakdown and before \\\\u0026 after shots,  it\\'s nothing short of magic. As a movie lover, filmmaker, and vfx artist, I can easily say that the visual effect studios and genius people behind the scenes are heroes to the Avengers series.

Shown in the video are effects from Red Giant, Rowbyte, Video Copilot, and stock AE. There are so many effects for After Effects out there, that finding the best and most useful can be a daunting task. These are the top 50 most popular effects for motion designers, VFX artists, and animators using After Effects that I\\'ve come across. Not all are the best or useful for everyday situations, but hands down for niche effects like making footage look glitchy, vintage, or retro, these will save a bunch of time. \\\\n\\\\nWhether you\\'re new to the program and interested in learning motion graphics, or an expert that knows your way around AE; this video shows what various effects can do to your raw footage. Some are powerful, others handy. I\\'ve messed around with a bunch of motion graphics and VFX in After Effects, and these effects are the ones I come across all the time.
