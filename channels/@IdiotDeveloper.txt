    "desc": "In this video, we are going to implement another biomedical image segmentation architecture called ColonSegNet. ColonSegNet is an encoder-decoder architecture developed for the purpose of polyp segmentation. The encoder learns to extract all the necessary information from the input image, which is then passed to the decoder. The decoder uses this information to generate a segmentation mask. The ColonSegNet uses Residual block with Squeeze and Excitation as the main component. The network is designed to have very few parameters as compared to other baseline architecture such as U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLabV3+. The use of fewer parameters makes the ColonSegNet a lightweight network that leads to real-time performance.\\\\n\\\\nResearch Paper: https://github.com/DebeshJha/ColonSegNet/blob/main/access.pdf\\\\n\\\\nCode: https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/Semantic-Segmentation-Architecture/blob/main/TensorFlow/notebook/ColonSegNet.ipynb\\\\n\\\\nSupport:\\\\n- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClkqp31PHke-f8b8mjiiY-Q/join\\\\n- https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\n\\\\nFollow Me:\\\\nBLOG:   https://idiotdeveloper.com https://sciencetonight.com\\\\nTELEGRAM: https://t.me/idiotdeveloper\\\\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\nTWITTER:   https://twitter.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\n\\\\nMy Gears:\\\\nIntel i5-7400: https://amzn.to/3ilpq95\\\\nGigabyte GA-B250M-D2V: https://amzn.to/3oPuntd\\\\nZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060: https://amzn.to/2XNtsxn\\\\nLG 22MP68VQ 22 inch IPS Monitor: https://amzn.to/3soUKs5\\\\nCorsair VENGEANCE LPX 16GB: https://amzn.to/2LVyR2L\\\\nWD Green 240 GB SSD: https://amzn.to/3igt1Ft\\\\n1TB WD Blue: https://amzn.to/38I6uhw\\\\nCorsair VS550 550W: https://amzn.to/3nILHi3\\\\nZebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Speakers: https://amzn.to/2XGu203\\\\nSegate 1TB Portable Hard Disk: https://amzn.to/3bF8YPG\\\\nSeagate Backup Plus Hub 8 TB External HDD: https://amzn.to/39wcqtj\\\\nMaono AU-A04 Condenser Microphone: https://amzn.to/35HHiWC\\\\nTechlicious 3.5mm Clip Microphone: https://amzn.to/3bERKSD\\\\nRedgear Dagger Headphones: https://amzn.to/3ssZNYr\"",

It is an improvement over the existing FCN \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d developed by Jonathan Long et al. in (2014).\\\\n\\\\nUNET  is a U-shaped encoder-decoder network architecture consisting of four encoder blocks and four decoder blocks connected via a bridge. The encoder network (contracting path) half the spatial dimensions and double the number of filters (feature channels) at each encoder block. Likewise, the decoder network doubles the spatial dimensions and half the number of feature channels\\\\n\\\\nCode (GitHub): https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/UNet-Segmentation-in-Keras-TensorFlow/blob/master/unet-segmentation.ipynb\\\\nBlog Post: https://idiotdeveloper.com/unet-segmentation-in-tensorflow/\\\\n\\\\nU-Net: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597\\\\nResU-Net: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10684\\\\nDoubleU-Net: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04868\\\\n\\\\nFollow Me:\\\\nBLOG:   https://idiotdeveloper.com https://sciencetonight.com\\\\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\nTWITTER:   https://twitter.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\n\\\\nMy Gears:\\\\nIntel i5-7400: https://amzn.to/3ilpq95\\\\nGigabyte GA-B250M-D2V: https://amzn.to/3oPuntd\\\\nZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060: https://amzn.to/2XNtsxn\\\\nLG 22MP68VQ 22 inch IPS Monitor: https://amzn.to/3soUKs5\\\\nCorsair VENGEANCE LPX 16GB: https://amzn.to/2LVyR2L\\\\nWD Green 240 GB SSD: https://amzn.to/3igt1Ft\\\\n1TB WD Blue: https://amzn.to/38I6uhw\\\\nCorsair VS550 550W: https://amzn.to/3nILHi3\\\\nZebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Speakers: https://amzn.to/2XGu203\\\\nSegate 1TB Portable Hard Disk: https://amzn.to/3bF8YPG\\\\nSeagate Backup Plus Hub 8 TB External HDD: https://amzn.to/39wcqtj\\\\nMaono AU-A04 Condenser Microphone: https://amzn.to/35HHiWC\\\\nTechlicious 3.5mm Clip Microphone: https://amzn.to/3bERKSD\\\\nRedgear Dagger Headphones: https://amzn.to/3ssZNYr\"",

A GAN consists of two models: a generator and a discriminator, both of which are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. The generator learns to generate images that look like real images, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between the real and the fake images.\\\\n\\\\nHow is DCGAN different from Vanilla GAN?\\\\nThe vanilla GAN developed by Ian Goodfellow is based on the dense or fully-connected layer. The DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is an extension of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and is built using the convolutional and transpose convolution layers.\\\\n\\\\nCODE: https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/DCGAN-on-Anime-Faces/\\\\nBLOG: https://idiotdeveloper.com/dcgan-implementing-deep-convolutional-generative-adversarial-network-in-tensorflow/\\\\nDATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/soumikrakshit/anime-faces\\\\n\\\\nSemantic Segmentation: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpiJOv-9XktL0SaS4Os7Yua2\\\\n\\\\nDeep Learning with MNIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpgQc9gRmeUPChX536wVO3ns\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction to TensorFlow: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpisJoIMv-L2awUGBf7oH1qF\\\\n\\\\nSupport:\\\\n- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClkqp31PHke-f8b8mjiiY-Q/join\\\\n- https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\n\\\\nMY GEARS:\\\\nIntel i5-7400: https://amzn.to/3ilpq95\\\\nGigabyte GA-B250M-D2V: https://amzn.to/3oPuntd\\\\nZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060: https://amzn.to/2XNtsxn\\\\nLG 22MP68VQ 22 inch IPS Monitor: https://amzn.to/3soUKs5\\\\nCorsair VENGEANCE LPX 16GB: https://amzn.to/2LVyR2L\\\\nWD Green 240 GB SSD: https://amzn.to/3igt1Ft\\\\n1TB WD Blue: https://amzn.to/38I6uhw\\\\nCorsair VS550 550W: https://amzn.to/3nILHi3\\\\nZebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Speakers: https://amzn.to/2XGu203\\\\nSegate 1TB Portable Hard Disk: https://amzn.to/3bF8YPG\\\\nSeagate Backup Plus Hub 8 TB External HDD: https://amzn.to/39wcqtj\\\\nMaono AU-A04 Condenser Microphone: https://amzn.to/35HHiWC\\\\nTechlicious 3.5mm Clip Microphone: https://amzn.to/3bERKSD\\\\nRedgear Dagger Headphones: https://amzn.to/3ssZNYr\\\\n\\\\nFOLLOW ME ON:\\\\nBLOG:   https://idiotdeveloper.com https://sciencetonight.com\\\\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\nTWITTER:   https://twitter.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/idiotdeveloper\"",

    "desc": "Stop-and-wait ARQ also referred to as alternating bit protocol, is a method in telecommunications to send information between two connected devices. It ensures that information is not lost due to dropped packets and that packets are received in the correct order. It is the simplest automatic repeat-request (ARQ) mechanism. A stop-and-wait ARQ sender sends one frame at a time; it is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with transmitting and receive window sizes equal to one and greater than one respectively. After sending each frame, the sender doesn\\'t send any further frames until it receives an acknowledgement (ACK) signal. After receiving a valid frame, the receiver sends an ACK. If the ACK does not reach the sender before a certain time, known as the timeout, the sender sends the same frame again. The timeout countdown is reset after each frame transmission. The above behaviour is a basic example of Stop-and-Wait. However, real-life implementations vary to address certain issues of design.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nhis program on STOP and WAIT ARQ Protocol in UDP in C Programming Language.\\\\nThere are 2 files:\\\\n1. Client.c: This file sends Data Frame to the Server and waits for the Acknowledgement.\\\\n2.

    "desc": "TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google\\'s Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.\\\\n\\\\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/XOR-gate-using-Tensorflow\\\\n\\\\nSemantic Segmentation: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpiJOv-9XktL0SaS4Os7Yua2\\\\n\\\\nDeep Learning with MNIST: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpgQc9gRmeUPChX536wVO3ns\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction to TensorFlow: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHYn9gDxQOpisJoIMv-L2awUGBf7oH1qF\\\\n\\\\nMY GEARS:\\\\nIntel i5-7400: https://amzn.to/3ilpq95\\\\nGigabyte GA-B250M-D2V: https://amzn.to/3oPuntd\\\\nZOTAC GeForce GTX 1060: https://amzn.to/2XNtsxn\\\\nLG 22MP68VQ 22 inch IPS Monitor: https://amzn.to/3soUKs5\\\\nCorsair VENGEANCE LPX 16GB: https://amzn.to/2LVyR2L\\\\nWD Green 240 GB SSD: https://amzn.to/3igt1Ft\\\\n1TB WD Blue: https://amzn.to/38I6uhw\\\\nCorsair VS550 550W: https://amzn.to/3nILHi3\\\\nZebronics BT4440RUCF 4.1 Speakers: https://amzn.to/2XGu203\\\\nSegate 1TB Portable Hard Disk: https://amzn.to/3bF8YPG\\\\nSeagate Backup Plus Hub 8 TB External HDD: https://amzn.to/39wcqtj\\\\nMaono AU-A04 Condenser Microphone: https://amzn.to/35HHiWC\\\\nTechlicious 3.5mm Clip Microphone: https://amzn.to/3bERKSD\\\\nRedgear Dagger Headphones: https://amzn.to/3ssZNYr\\\\n\\\\nFOLLOW ME ON:\\\\nBLOG:   https://idiotdeveloper.com https://sciencetonight.com\\\\nFACEBOOK:  https://www.facebook.com/idiotdeveloper\\\\nTWITTER:   https://twitter.com/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram/nikhilroxtomar\\\\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/idiotdeveloper\"",
