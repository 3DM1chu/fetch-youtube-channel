You can get an API key by visiting https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.\\\\n- Free credits offered by OpenAI: If you are using the free credits offered by OpenAI to use their models, you can check your usage at https://beta.openai.com/account/usage. If you have used up your free credits, you can check the pricing and upgrade your account at https://openai.com/api/pricing/.\\\\n- Proper server deployment: Make sure you use the deployed link from Render at https://render.com/. If you are unsure how to deploy the project, follow the steps mentioned in the video.\\\\n- After successfully deploying the link, make sure to paste the link in the script file of the client and push it to GitHub. This will allow Vercel to detect and deploy the application properly. Also, please note that the server link used in the Codex repository shared on GitHub has used all of its credits, so it will throw a 429 error and will not work. You will need to use your own server link by deploying it on Render or using another hosting service.\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x9bGot stuck?

What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we\\'ll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. Along the way, you\\'ll learn how to use Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, API data fetching, all of it in React JS!\\\\n\\\\nThe project is going to fetch the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. In this video, we also use React Hooks! By the end of this video, you will have a strong understanding of React\\'s workflow; including data fetching, hooks, folder structure, and more.\\\\n\\\\nDisclaimer: The API used in this video stopped displaying the daily values. The whole project still works absolutely fine. If you want to have the daily data (and a corresponding chart), I found the API that offers the daily data for the US and implemented it.
