We will start with the installations and setup and then move on to the fundamentals of computer vision. From there we will learn the concept of modules and how we can create efficient modular code that can be used in different projects. Then we will create 3 different projects to apply what we have learned in real-life applications. The first project is Eye-tracking where we will teach the Nano to track a human face then we have a Robot car we will build and program the car to track  Objects and follow lanes like a self-driving car. The last project will be Face attendance where we will learn to recognize faces and store them in a Real-time database. \\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f  Enroll Now in the Complete Course  \\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3L8uIlF\\\\nBy Enrolling in the course you will get access to the complete course including code and 3d printing files.\\\\n\\\\nPremium Courses: \\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Computer Vision Game Development Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3ttLZ2s\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Computer Vision with Arduino Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3wzLB4m\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Advanced Drone Programming Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3qs3v5g\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Learn to Build Computer Vision Mobile Apps:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3uioY1J\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Jetson Nano Premium Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3L8uIlF\\\\n\\\\nFollow Me:\\\\nTikTok: https://bit.ly/3Vo76OQ\\\\nFacebook Group: https://bit.ly/3irDcb7\\\\nDiscord: https://bit.ly/3JvyxAM  \\\\nFacebook Page: https://bit.ly/3IvpU7W\\\\nInstagram : https://bit.ly/3NdGME3\\\\nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3ICFTS0\\\\nGithub: https://bit.ly/3woU6PS\\\\n\\\\nProduct Links:\\\\nRecommend Webcam for Computer Vision: https://amzn.to/2MNtVKZ\\\\nBudget Webcam: https://amzn.to/2ZP47Ug\\\\nComputer Vision Robot Arm : https://amzn.to/3L1YacX\\\\nCheap Drone for OpenCV: https://amzn.to/2TZpsJy\\\\nDC Motors + Wheels + Chassis: https://amzn.to/2SCZon3\\\\nDC Motors + Wheels: https://amzn.to/2QeEusw\\\\nArduino UNO: https://amzn.to/3Jwpz6h\\\\nMotor Driver: https://amzn.to/35grl6x\\\\nBattery: https://amzn.to/2Fadc0c\\\\nRaspberry Pi 4 Best Starter Kit:  https://amzn.to/3JvnEz1\\\\nRaspberry Pi Recommended Battery: https://amzn.to/2C0I9pl\\\\n\\\\nMy Setup:\\\\nMouse: https://amzn.to/3tsx3BR\\\\nMechanical Keyboard: https://amzn.to/3JyVV0q\\\\nNormal Keyboard: https://amzn.to/3L325WJ\\\\nGPU: https://amzn.to/3NdzmjW\\\\nCPU: https://amzn.to/3wsmhgI\\\\nSSD: https://amzn.to/3wzY7AS\\\\nMIC: https://amzn.to/3D43TMk\\\\nCamera: https://amzn.to/36yvl90\\\\n3D Printer: https://amzn.to/3ipWNZ4\\\\nSim Race: https://amzn.to/3IqfvKJ\\\\n\\\\n#ComputerVision\\\\n#OpenCV\\\\n#CVZone\\\\n\\\\nTime Stamps: \\\\n00:00 Intro\\\\n1:28\\xe2\\x80\\x8b  Downloads\\\\n4:53\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Setup\\\\n10:21\\xe2\\x80\\x8b IDE\\\\n14:02\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Chapter 1\\\\n24:37\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Chapter 2\\\\n38:21\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Chapter 3\\\\n48:43\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Chapter 4\\\\n59:51\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Concept of Modules\\\\n1:08:01\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Face Detection Module\\\\n1:30:05 Color Detection Module\\\\n1:30:52\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Shape Detection Module\\\\n1:31:07\\xe2\\x80\\x8b GPIO Basics\\\\n1:40:15 LED Module\\\\n1:49:39\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Arduino Serial Introduction\\\\n1:55:48 Arduino Install\\\\n1:57:41\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Serial Receive Arduino\\\\n2:21:07\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Serial Receive Python\\\\n2:35:21\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Serial Send Python\\\\n2:36:20\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Introduction\\\\n2:40:47\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Assembly\\\\n2:41:07\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Wiring\\\\n2:41:26\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Motor Center\\\\n2:51:15\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Serial Control\\\\n2:56:18\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Python Code\\\\n3:39:37\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Eye Tracking - Result\\\\n3:41:40\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Parts\\\\n3:41:59\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Assembly\\\\n3:42:15\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Wiring\\\\n3:42:40 Robot Car - Motor Test\\\\n3:52:35\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Motor Function\\\\n4:06:31\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Motor Serial\\\\n4:11:51\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Keyboard Control\\\\n4:28:07\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Keyboard Control Result\\\\n4:28:34\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Object Tracking Result\\\\n4:29:35\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Robot Car - Lane Following Result\\\\n4:30:57\\xe2\\x80\\x8b Face Attendance - Result\"",

Like before we are going to learn the basics that include Processing images videos webcams and finding shapes colors, humans, and vehicle number plates. We will also have 3 example projects that will cover all the basics we have learned. C++ is an excellent language for implementation and creating real-world products. so having this advanced computer vision skill on your CV will really make it stand out from the competition. And Don\\'t worry if you are a beginner we will go step by step right from the installation up to creating exciting projects, And our main focus will be practical implementation so we will skip all the boring theory stuff.\\\\n\\\\nCourse Link - Code + Files:  \\\\nhttps://www.computervision.zone/courses/opencv-cv/\\\\n\\\\nPremium Courses: \\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Computer Vision Game Development Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3ttLZ2s\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Computer Vision with Arduino Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3wzLB4m\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Advanced Drone Programming Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3qs3v5g\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Learn to Build Computer Vision Mobile Apps:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3uioY1J\\\\n\\xe2\\x9c\\x94\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Jetson Nano Premium Course:\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/3L8uIlF\\\\n\\\\nFollow Me:\\\\nTikTok: https://bit.ly/3Vo76OQ\\\\nFacebook Group: https://bit.ly/3irDcb7\\\\nDiscord: https://bit.ly/3JvyxAM  \\\\nFacebook Page: https://bit.ly/3IvpU7W\\\\nInstagram : https://bit.ly/3NdGME3\\\\nWebsite: https://bit.ly/3ICFTS0\\\\nGithub: https://bit.ly/3woU6PS\\\\n\\\\nProduct Links:\\\\nRecommend Webcam for Computer Vision: https://amzn.to/2MNtVKZ\\\\nBudget Webcam: https://amzn.to/2ZP47Ug\\\\nComputer Vision Robot Arm : https://amzn.to/3L1YacX\\\\nCheap Drone for OpenCV: https://amzn.to/2TZpsJy\\\\nDC Motors + Wheels + Chassis: https://amzn.to/2SCZon3\\\\nDC Motors + Wheels: https://amzn.to/2QeEusw\\\\nArduino UNO: https://amzn.to/3Jwpz6h\\\\nMotor Driver: https://amzn.to/35grl6x\\\\nBattery: https://amzn.to/2Fadc0c\\\\nRaspberry Pi 4 Best Starter Kit:  https://amzn.to/3JvnEz1\\\\nRaspberry Pi Recommended Battery: https://amzn.to/2C0I9pl\\\\n\\\\nMy Setup:\\\\nMouse: https://amzn.to/3tsx3BR\\\\nMechanical Keyboard: https://amzn.to/3JyVV0q\\\\nNormal Keyboard: https://amzn.to/3L325WJ\\\\nGPU: https://amzn.to/3NdzmjW\\\\nCPU: https://amzn.to/3wsmhgI\\\\nSSD: https://amzn.to/3wzY7AS\\\\nMIC: https://amzn.to/3D43TMk\\\\nCamera: https://amzn.to/36yvl90\\\\n3D Printer: https://amzn.to/3ipWNZ4\\\\nSim Race: https://amzn.to/3IqfvKJ\\\\n\\\\n#ComputerVision\\\\n#OpenCV\\\\n#CVZone\\\\n\\\\nTime Stamps:\\\\n00:00 Intro\\\\n1:24 Introduction to Images\\\\n3:48  Installation - Windows\\\\n11:51 Installation - Mac\\\\n22:05 Chapter 1 - Read Images Videos and Webcams \\\\n35:23 Chapter 2 - Basic Functions\\\\n50:21 Chapter 3 - Resize and Crop \\\\n58:31 Chapter 4 - Drawing Shapes and Text\\\\n01:11:07 Chapter 5 - Warp Perspective \\\\n01:22:40 Chapter 6 - Color Detection\\\\n01:37:17 Chapter 7 - Shapes/Contour Detection\\\\n02:14:52 Chapter8 - Face Detection\\\\n02:22:21 Project 1 - Virtual Painter\\\\n03:02:52 Project 2 - Document Scanner\\\\n03:46:14 Project 3 - License Plate Detector\"",
