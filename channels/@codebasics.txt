In this video, I will provide a very simple explanation of Metaverse and also discuss career opportunities associated with it.\\\\n\\\\nMetaverse is the future of the internet, the future of everything!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Many tech CEOs have quoted this in one or the other way. But what exactly is Metaverse? Watch this video to know everything you ever wanted to know about the future of the internet. In simple words, the metaverse is the next generation internet technology that is to improve the current 2D experience, by making it more realistic. How exactly does this happen? It is as simple as wearing a VRS headset. The next milestone of this will be a physical touch experience through the 3D world.\\\\n\\\\nWith this, our remote working style is much more likely to revolutionize and not be restricted to the 2D rectangular box. It won\\'t be only restricted to the people of IT \\\\u0026 software industry but also factory workers will be able to enjoy the privilege of working from home. With this, the remote working culture will be in boom and thus allowing people from lower opportunity regions to get hired across the world.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the boom of the metaverse is likely to bring in many career opportunities. With the possible evolution of metaverse apps, the demand for metaverse app developers is also likely to be increasing. Following this, the career opportunities for blockchain developers and cyber security engineers are also likely to have a hike. When talking about creating real life in the digital world, the role of a digital artist is inevitable. Data scientists, data analysts, and ML engineers are going to be in huge demand, given the fact that there will be a lot of data created and an ever-growing demand for applying AI and data science on various use cases. Metaverse is going to build a great platform for educational creators, who can then be able to conduct 3D live virtual classes.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, with the good comes a bad part too. Keep watching this video to know about the possible negative impacts of the metaverse. Note, these are only my point of view. Metaverse is a rising wave and we have to either learn to fight it or surf through it.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Timestamps \\xe2\\xad\\x90\\xef\\xb8\\x8f\\\\n0:00 Introduction \\\\n0:21 What is Metaverse?\\\\n3:32 Metaverse demo\\\\n4:56 Benefits of the metaverse \\\\n5:25 Problems with the metaverse\\\\n7:21 Metaverse Career Opportunities\\\\n\\\\nDo you want to learn technology from me?

Your skill level doesn\\'t matter, because you can keep upgrading yourself. Followed by this, a strong data structure and algorithm foundation is a must. This allows you to write better and compact programs. Don\\'t forget to sharpen your debugging skills, and remember to use libraries wisely. PEP8 \\\\u0026 coding best practices will aid you in writing readable code. It is always advisable to contribute to open source and review codes. Through this, you get a chance to interact with experts, and you can improvise on your skills with their guide. While learning python, never be ashamed to ask for help. But understand, it is important to ask the right question. If you misinterpret the question, you would be led nowhere. The last but most important step in the python developer roadmap is- Projects!

Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don\\'t know programming and they can  try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn\\'t need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x96 Hashtags \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x96\\\\n#deeplearningwithpython #deeplearning #deeplearningtensorflow #deeplearningtutorialpython #deeplearningtutorial #deeplearningbegininer\\\\n\\\\nDo you want to learn technology from me?

In the video comment below, please post two types of feedback,\\\\n1) What questions or insights this report is generating for you? For example revenues from Electricsara stores clients are declining. So maybe we need to engage more with this client and try to figure out a way to increase our sales (maybe give them a special discount)\\\\n2) Say you are a sales director of Atliq hardware and now you started using this dashboard. What improvements do you want to make in this? For example, I want to see a pie chart of revenues from the top 5 clients. \\\\nWe will have the next 5 days to collect this feedback (till 2nd July).

There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. \\\\nData science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights.

In depth first search you can use in order traversal, pre order traversal and post order traversal schemes that will benefit in different scenarious.

We can\\'t measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants. Big O is used to measure space complexity as well, You will know how to find the time and space complexity of algorithms.\\\\n\\\\nClarification: At 5:05, the code should be print(str(numbers[i]) + \\\\\"",

Data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer are three different roles in the field of data science and data analytics. And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. \\\\nA data engineer is a software engineer who specializes in data-based technology and is well versed in extracting data from structured and unstructured sources. A data analyst is a person who has domain knowledge, while the data scientist has all the skillset like an analyst, but is also good at statistics and knows deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing. The difference between data analyst vs data scientist, is the expertise in statics. \\\\nA short summary of the difference is that a data engineer is like a raw material you need to prepare any dish, while the data scientist or analyst is the chef who can make the dish. \\\\n\\\\n#DataAnalyst #DataEngineer #DataScientist\\\\n\\\\nDo you want to learn technology from me?

Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,\\\\n1) Python\\\\n2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning\\\\n3) Matplotlib for data visualization\\\\n4) Sklearn for model building\\\\n5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE\\\\n6) Python flask for http server\\\\n7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI\\\\n\\\\nIn this particular video we will load banglore home prices data into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values.

In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don\\'t need to train it every time.
