This helps stop syntax highlighting getting confused.\\\\n\\\\nType Parameters: prefix your type arguments with T. If you\\'ve got only one type argument, you can use T. Otherwise, be more descriptive with your parameter names.\\\\n\\\\nAvoid Unnecessary Prefixes: Prefixes like IUser and TOrganization might feel useful, but they\\'re mostly just holdovers from the Java days.\\\\n\\\\n00:00 Intro\\\\n00:14 Never Pluralize\\\\n01:18 Casing\\\\n01:50 Type Parameters\\\\n02:44 Unnecessary Prefixes\\\\n03:35 Outro\\\\n\\\\nBecome a TypeScript Wizard with my free beginners TypeScript Course:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript\\\\n\\\\nFollow Matt on Twitter\\\\n\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/mattpocockuk\\\\n\\\\nJoin the Discord:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://mattpocock.com/discord\"",

The new useSWR mutation hook allows for updating data on the frontend before receiving word back from the server, making the application feel snappier. We can also use the new preload function to load data as soon as the JavaScript module comes into scope. The useSWR hook now also includes a newly added isLoading state, which triggers only once when loading data. The release also improves React 18 support and includes a migration guide for existing useSWR 1.0 users. While it\\'s difficult to say whether it may replace TanStack Query, useSWR is a great option to consider for data fetching in React-based applications.\\\\n\\\\nSWR: https://swr.vercel.app/\\\\nTanStack Query: https://tanstack.com/query/v4\\\\n\\\\nBecome a TypeScript Wizard with Matt\\'s upcoming TypeScript Course:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.totaltypescript.com/\\\\n\\\\nFollow Matt on Twitter\\\\n\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/mattpocockuk\"",
