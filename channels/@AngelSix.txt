Firstly we were getting multiple DbContext\\'s due to the Transient scope so that was fixed here https://github.com/angelsix/fasetto-word/commit/c0f064376e86f9002e02e300f27058ce1a05a5c8\\\\n\\\\nThen more importantly, the RunCommandAsync would not lock on the property itself, as we passed in an expression to get the property, and that expression would be a different copy every time the property changed. So to fix that I just globally lock the function for now, with how fast the check is that\\'s fine https://github.com/angelsix/fasetto-word/commit/3faf798e49cd8ff49bbd384c9b8d64645a410580\"",
