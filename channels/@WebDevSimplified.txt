One of those tasks is rendering popups and modals. It doesn\\'t make sense for them to be rendered inside a component, but you need to access them inside a component. This would lead to a impossible problem to solve, but React thought of this for you. Portals are a way for you to render an element somewhere else while still having access to it in the component you are working on. They are a bit complex at first, though, so in this video I breakdown React portals step by step.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x9a Materials/References:\\\\n\\\\nGitHub Code: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/React-Modal-Popup\\\\nReact Portal Blog Article: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2019-12/how-to-use-react-portal\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xa0 Concepts Covered:\\\\n\\\\n- How to use portals in React\\\\n- How to create a modal in React\\\\n- Portal best practices\\\\n- How events are handled in portals\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x8e Find Me Here:\\\\n\\\\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\\\\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#ReactPortal #WDS #ReactJs\"",

    "desc": "Writing clean code is tough, and is one of the largest differences between junior and senior developers. One way that you can quickly improve your code and start writing well designed code now is to implement the dependency inversion principle. This principle is part of the SOLID design principles.\\\\n\\\\nThe main idea of the dependency inversion principle is that any class that uses a dependency should only ever use the dependency through a predefined interface/wrapper. This makes it so that your code will never directly depend on a low level API for its operations. The reason this is so important is because if you ever need to change or remove that dependency it becomes really difficult when it is used all over your code. By wrapping this dependency in an interface you can depend on the interface you created which will make changing out the dependency painless.\\\\n\\\\nMost likely you have written tons of code in violation of this principle, I know I have, but hopefully this video will help introduce you to why this principle is so good at making your code clean and maintainable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x9a Materials/References:\\\\n\\\\nFacade Pattern Video: https://youtu.be/fHPa5xzbpaA\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xa0 Concepts Covered:\\\\n\\\\n- What the dependency inversion principle is\\\\n- Why the dependency inversion principle is important\\\\n- How to use the dependency inversion principle\\\\n- How to spot violations of the dependency inversion principle\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x8e Find Me Here:\\\\n\\\\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\\\\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#SOLID #WDS #DependencyInveresionPrinciple\"",

This principle is part of the SOLID design principles and is, in my opinion, the easiest rule of SOLID for to understand and implement. \\\\n\\\\nThe main idea of the interface segregation principle is that any class that implements an interface must use all functions/properties of the interface.

By getting up so early I was able to get a head start on my day which meant I could get tons of work done before most other people even think of getting up. On top of that it left me with more open afternoons to enjoy the nice weather and sunshine of the day. The reason this is so effective is because our will power is a resource which starts to run out after working a full day. This means that by the time we reach the end of the work day we have very little or no willpower to do the things we want. This is why I get up at 5AM so I can do all the productive activities I enjoy such as making these videos and going to the gym.

Unfortunately, pure object oriented programming is not the best solution to many problems. This is why in certain industries, like game development, the idea of composition has risen in popularity to overtake inheritance from object oriented programming. In this video I will explain the differences between inheritance and composition through one example program. I will also go in depth about the problems with using inheritance that composition solves.

One way that you can quickly improve your code and start writing well designed code now is to implement the single responsibility principle. This principle is part of the SOLID design principles and is, in my opinion, the most important rule of SOLID. This is because it is easy to implement and test for while still being incredibly useful in terms of making your code cleaner.\\\\n\\\\nThe main idea of the single responsibility principle is that every class/function/module/section of your code should have only one responsibility. This means that the code should only have one single reason to change. If there are two different reasons for the code to change, or if it does two distinctly different things then it is in violation of this principle and is potentially poorly designed code.\\\\n\\\\nMost likely you have written tons of code in violation of this principle, I know I have, but hopefully this video will help introduce you to why this principle is so good at making your code clean and maintainable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xa0 Concepts Covered:\\\\n\\\\n- What the single responsibility principle is\\\\n- Why the single responsibility principle is important\\\\n- How to use the single responsibility principle\\\\n- How to spot violations of the single responsibility principle\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x8e Find Me Here:\\\\n\\\\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\\\\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#SOLID #WDS #SingleResponsibilityPriniciple\"",

The idea of the command pattern is to create an abstraction between the operations an object can do, its commands, and the actual commands themselves. This makes it really easy to combine together or chain different commands without having to change the code. The program can dynamically chain and combine these actions. The best part is since each command is its own object you can easily implement and undo function for each command and make a set of undo-able actions.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x9a Materials/References:\\\\n\\\\nGitHub Code: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Design-Patterns/tree/master/Command%20Pattern\\\\nDesign Patterns Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWprw8UHIzA\\\\u0026list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH_CthENcPCM0Dww6a5XYC7f\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xa0 Concepts Covered:\\\\n\\\\n- What the command pattern is\\\\n- Why the command pattern is important\\\\n- How to implement the command pattern in JavaScript\\\\n- When to use the command pattern\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x8e Find Me Here:\\\\n\\\\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\\\\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\\\\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#CommandPattern #WDS #DesignPatterns\"",

In this video I will cover what MVC is, how it works, and why you should use it.\\\\n\\\\nMVC stands for Model, View, Controller. It is used to define how these three different entities can interact with each other.\\\\n\\\\nThe Controller handles user requests and delegates information between the Model and the View. It only deals with requests, and never handles data or presentation.\\\\n\\\\nThe Model handles data validation, logic, and persistence. It interacts directly with the database to handle the data. The Controller will get all of its data information by asking the Model about the data.\\\\n\\\\nThe View handles presenting the information. It will usually render dynamic HTML pages based on the data the model fetches. The Controller is responsible for passing that data between the Model and View, so that the Model and View never have to interact with each other.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Video:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/6sUbt-Qp6Pg\\\\n\\\\nNext Video:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/qj2oDkvc4dQ\\\\n\\\\nPlaylist:\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTwitter:\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nGitHub:\\\\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nCodePen:\\\\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#MVC #WebDevelopment #ModelViewController\"",

    "desc": "If you have used any modern website, then chances are you have interacted with a website that uses REST. Even YouTube uses RESTful URLs on its site, but what exactly is REST? For starters, REST stands for Representation State Transfer and is just a fancy way of saying that a server responds to create, read, update, and delete requests in a standard way. The idea behind REST is to treat all server URLs as access points for the various resources on the server. For example in this URL, http://example.com/users, users represents the resource that the server is exposing. As mentioned earlier, REST needs a way to create, read, update, and delete these resources and it does so with the following five URLs.\\\\nhttp://example.com/users\\\\nhttp://example.com/users\\\\nhttp://example.com/users/1\\\\nhttp://example.com/users/1\\\\nhttp://example.com/users/1\\\\n\\\\nThe first two URLs do not have an ID so they act on the entire user\\'s resource, while the last three URLs do have an ID in their URL and thus act on only a single user resource, but as you may notice there are only two distinct URLs. That is because REST uses the four basic HTTP actions, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to determine what to do with each URL. If we add in those actions to the URLs it is much easier to see what each of the URLs do.\\\\n[GET]     http://example.com/users\\\\n[POST]    http://example.com/users\\\\n[GET]     http://example.com/users/1\\\\n[PUT]     http://example.com/users/1\\\\n[DELETE]  http://example.com/users/1\\\\n\\\\nThe first URL we have is the GET users URL, and it is used to get a list of all users. In REST when a GET URL does not have an ID it acts upon the entire resource and will always return a list of every item in that resource. The GET action in REST corresponds with reading data.\\\\n\\\\nThe second URL, which is almost identical to the first, is used to create a new user. In REST the POST action corresponds with creation, and should always be used on the entire resource by not using an ID in the URL.\\\\n\\\\nThe third URL is another GET URL, but this URL is for getting only a single user based on the id that is in the URL. The ID portion of the URL is used by REST to determine which resource from the collection of resources it should act upon. In the case of this URL it is used to return the user with that ID.\\\\n\\\\nThe fourth URL is the most confusing of them all, but it is used to update a user with the given ID. The PUT action in REST corresponds with update and works very similarly to POST, but instead of creating a new resource it updates an existing resource.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, we have the most straight forward URL of them all which is for deleting a user with a specific ID. The DELETE action in REST does exactly what you would think and deletes the resource with the given ID.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn order for a website to use REST, the URLs do not need to be formatted exactly the same as above. For example using these URLs would still be considered RESTful, but most applications will use the previously mentioned URLs.\\\\n[GET]     http://example.com/users\\\\n[POST]    http://example.com/users\\\\n[GET]     http://example.com/users/details/1\\\\n[PUT]     http://example.com/users/update/1\\\\n[DELETE]  http://example.com/users/delete/1\\\\n\\\\nThe only thing that matters with REST is that the URLs used represent a resource, in this case a user, and that they support creating, reading, updating, and deleting from that resource using the HTTP actions GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\\\\n\\\\nPrevious Video:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/4r6WdaY3SOA\\\\n\\\\nNext Video:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/DUg2SWWK18I\\\\n\\\\nPlaylist:\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTwitter:\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nGitHub:\\\\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nCodePen:\\\\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#REST #WebDevelopment #RESTful\"",

    "desc": "As we already know, the web is made up of two main parts. The frontend and the backend. The frontend is concerned with presentation and is fairly easy to understand since it is what we interact with daily on the web. The backend, on the other hand, is all of the parts of the web that users do not directly interact with. In this video we are going to discuss the basics of how the backend of a website works by tracing all of the steps that the backend must go through from the moment it receives a request to the point it sends a response back to the client.\\\\n\\\\nStarting at the beginning the server will receive a request from a client in the form of a URL. From this URL the server can get almost all of the information it needs in order to process a request. Let\\'s break apart a typical URL. At the beginning we have the protocol for the request. The only thing that the protocol does is tell the server if the request is encrypted. HTTP is for standard non-encrypted requests, and HTTPS is for encrypted requests. Other than telling the server if the response is encrypted or not the protocol doesn\\'t affect the way the server handles requests and can be ignored. Next, we have the host, also known as the domain name. Again, this is not important to worry about for the server since all it does is tell the internet which server to send the response to. Each server has their own particular host, so once the request actually gets to the server the host does not matter since all requests for the server will have the same host. For example, youtube.com is the host for the YouTube server, so the YouTube server already knows that all requests it gets will have the host youtube.com. This means that we can safely ignore the first half of the URL which leaves us with the last two sections of the URL. The path and the query string. The path tells the server what the client wants and defines which section of code on the server should be run in order to get the correct response. Essentially the server is broken down into a bunch of different sections which all correspond to a specific path. Lastly the query string is used by the specific section of the server to alter the response. The query string is broken down into specific query parameters which can augment the way that the server responds to a request for a specific path. For example YouTube uses the same path when you search for a video, but the query string contains a search_query parameter which tells the server what you searched for so it can respond with what you want.\\\\n\\\\nThe URL alone is not enough to tell the server exactly what it needs to do, though. It can tell the server which section to look for and how to alter that section based on the query parameters, but that section of the server is broken down even further into multiple different parts. To determine which part of that section the server should run it needs to use an action which is passed along with the URL. This action can either be GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. By combining the action and the path the server can find the correct part of the correct section that it needs to run. It can then use the query parameters to alter the response of that particular part and section.\\\\n\\\\nNormally the response from the server will be an HTML page that is dynamically generated based on the request from the client. This is why when you go to the YouTube search page it always shows you the same page, since it has the same path and action, but the videos that are returned from your search are different based on the query parameter for your search.\\\\n\\\\nAnother important thing to note about a server is that it is only accessible to the outside world through the sections that it defines. This means that you can store any secure information on the server and it will be safe as long as it is not exposed through a specific path. This is why it is safe to have a database and website running on the same server since the server only chooses to expose the website and not the database. Essentially the server acts as a barrier between the outside world and all the parts of a website.\\\\n\\\\nNext Video:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/6sUbt-Qp6Pg\\\\n\\\\nPlaylist:\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8jbFkBjOuFjhxANC63OmXM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTwitter:\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/DevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nGitHub:\\\\nhttps://github.com/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\nCodePen:\\\\nhttps://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#Backend #WebDevelopment #Programming\"",
