A 100 meter city block would take up 100 units. ARKit and ARCore also work natively in meters. Sounds like a perfect match. For some AR experiences, you may want to have assets that match up perfectly to the world. For example, a mannequin of your height showing you the latest fashions that you can walk around. For table top experiences, you will generally will want your assets to size down to fit within the play area on your table. In this example, our Ragin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rooster city, when put into AR, is taking up 100 meters in physical space, just like a real city block. As most tables are around half a meter in size, we have a problem fitting our city onto the table.\\\\n\\\\nMore Details at:\\\\nhttps://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/11/16/dealing-with-scale-in-ar/\\\\n\\\\nAlso please don\\'t forget to SUBSCRIBE as it helps me in creating more videos like this or better!\\\\n\\\\nGet realtime tips from me in Twitter\\\\nhttps://www.twitter.com/dilmerv\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe to my videos \\\\u0026 game releases newsletter\\\\nhttps://www.dilmergames.com\\\\n\\\\nBlog \\\\nhttps://www.dilmergames.com/blog\"",
