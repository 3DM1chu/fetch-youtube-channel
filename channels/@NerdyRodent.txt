Welcome to the text-generation-webui! A gradio web UI for running Large Language Models like GPT-J 6B, OPT, GALACTICA, LLaMA, Pygmalion and many, many more! Whisper and TTS included, allowing you to speak to your characters and have them speak back too.\\\\n\\\\nSimple, error free install every time on Linux.\\\\n\\\\nThanks to huggingface there is a massive library of models, many with Open Source licenses just ready for you to use! Create any custom character you like and take it for a spin - even with just 8GB VRAM. Some models work with much less too \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x80\\\\n\\\\nIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like standard installations, you can also use the obfuscated method. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just 3 simple steps:\\\\n1. Install using the 1-click installer\\\\n2. Download your model(s)\\\\n3.

The original film was a silent black \\\\u0026 white production, filmed using a hand-cranked Bell \\\\u0026 Howell 35mm camera. \\\\n\\\\nThe journey begins at 8th Street and continues eastward to the cable car turntable, at The Embarcadero, in front of the Ferry Building. Landmarks passed in the latter part of the first half include the Call Building (then San Francisco\\'s tallest) and the Palace Hotel (both on the right; Lotta\\'s Fountain is on the left between the two but is in the shade).\\\\n\\\\nThe near total lack of traffic control along Market Street emphasizes the newness of the automobile.

Import everything into HitFilm 14 for compositing. I added an effect or two, such as some colouring, drop shadow and outlining. Export as an .mp4, ready for Butterflow.\\\\n6. Run the HitFilm export through butterflow to get 60fps, as well as adding a load of additional frames through interpolation by slowing it down. Play with the options, depending on the video contents. \\\\n7. Import the buttery smooth render back into HitFilm and garnish with a little music, text and any final effects.\\\\n8.

First I took a 24 FPS video of lemons and limes from Pexels, exported it as a PNG sequence, ran various frames through Deep Dream  Generator, resized them up to 1920x1080 with waifu2x, styled them with EbSynth then added around 10,000 new interpolated frames using butterflow in order to create a 60fps 1080p slow motion video. A little compositing in Hitfilm, and it was ready to serve.\\\\n\\\\nThen I did it again with a jellyfish video, and thus Synthetic Lemon Jelly Fish Butter was created for your viewing pleasure.\\\\n\\\\nI do hope you enjoy!\"",

I can\\'t even play it play in 8k :D Something to test those new AMD Ryzen 9 processors on when July finally arrives? $399 for the same power as a $1200 Intel? Good going, AMD.\\\\n\\\\nInstructions:\\\\nIt\\'s a 360 degree fractal. Best seen in virtual reality with a 360 video viewer, but also funky on computers and mobiles too (though you probably don\\'t have an 8k mobile device unless it is 2024 already).\\\\n\\\\nMove your head, mouse, or use the WASD keys, whatever works for you. Play the video and look in whatever direction you feel like looking in.\\\\n\\\\nFind the hidden text and comment below! Yes, there is a hidden, secret message in there... somewhere :)\\\\n\\\\nIngredients:\\\\n2 x Hand-crafted Mandelbulber v2 fractal designs \\\\n 1 x 7680 x 3840 equirectangular background fractal (1 frame, jpg, render time 40 mins)\\\\n 1 x 7680 x 3840 equirectangular foreground fractal (1,200 frames, jpg, render time ~3 hours)\\\\n1 x HitFilm (or anything else for stitching and compositing) (render time ~2 hours)\\\\n1 x Handbrake - https://handbrake.fr/ (render time variable)\\\\n1 x spatial metadata injector - https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases\\\\n\\\\nTotal compute time required: ~6 hours\\\\nWatch time required: 2 mins\\\\n\\\\nEfficiency rating: F\\\\n\\\\nRecipe:\\\\nRender the foreground fractal over the background fractal to get your 1,200 jpg images (~66GB of data). Stitch the jpg files together and add some music from the YouTube audio library, along with whatever effects you fancy for lols and rofls. I used a hue shift because colours.\\\\n\\\\nLeave to bake until you have your 35GB high quality file. Run that file through HandBrake, making sure to use H.265 for sweet 8k mp4 goodness. Maybe HitFilm will have H.265 support one day?\\\\n\\\\nLeave to bake again until your near-ready mp4 file is just browning. The resulting video file should now be a mere fraction of the original size. In my case, it was around 900MB. Finally, inject the spatial metadata as normal, and upload the final file to YouTube.\\\\n\\\\nToday I learnt:\\\\n1. VLC doesn\\'t seem to like any 8k file, so I can\\'t test anything before uploading.\\\\n2. I tried using Avidemux, but it didn\\'t work (at all) for 8k files.\\\\n3. I now love Handbrake!\\\\n\\\\nBonus tip for reading to the end:\\\\nThe thumbnail. Yeah. The one that looks wiggly? That is the flat horizon without the spherical viewer. Yes, that wiggle is FLAT when viewed spherically :)\\\\n\\\\nMandelbulber v2:\\\\nhttps://github.com/buddhi1980/mandelbulber2\\\\n\\\\n#Fractal #Art #Mandelbulber\"",
