Python image processing is very important for anyone interested in computer vision and data science. Using the popular python packages matplotlib and opencv you will learn how to open image data, how the data is formatted, some ways to manipulate the data and save it off in a different format. If you enjoy you can also check out my live twitch streams (below). Image data is extremely powerful especially with machine learning and computer vision techniuqes becoming more common.
