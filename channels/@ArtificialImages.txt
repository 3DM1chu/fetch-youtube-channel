Often intended for the surprise, delight and edification of grandchildren by grandparents, these books had the analogical potential to become flamboyant transmogrifigations of the detritus and sequestered oddments of the great age of print in the later half of the 19th century.\\\\n\\\\nThe fortuitous collocation of views of towns, voyages of exploration, catastrophes, battle scenes and royal portraits become mantic in the deft hands of an expert sniper such as Hans Christian Andersen or the unknown creator of Ernst Will\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picture book in war-time Vienna.\\\\nFrom: https://isea-archives.siggraph.org/art-events/ernst-wills-picture-book-a-euro-rebus-by-peter-callas/\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\\\nPeter Callas is one of the key artists working with new media in Australia. His work in video, installation and digital media examines themes of national identity, history and memory. His work, particularly in video in the 1980s, was notable for its high end production values and innovative installation techniques in gallery settings.\\\\n\\\\nKey works by Callas, such as If Pigs Could Fly (The Media Machine) (1987), Night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s High Noon: An Anti-Terrain (1988) and Neo Geo: An American Purchase (1990), are prime examples of Callas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thematic concerns, appropriating images of Australian and American popular culture and animating them using simple techniques, often placed over pulsating and psychedelic backgrounds created via technologies such as the Fairlight CVI. Callas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works are sharply critical of the received wisdoms of history and those often convenient political alliances \\xe2\\x80\\x94 personal, national and global \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that whitewash the present to obscure the past: a pointed political stance leavened by a sense of the absurd.\\\\n\\\\nAfter studies at the University of Sydney, where he gained a BA (Hons) in 1974, Callas obtained a Diploma of Art from Sydney College of the Arts in 1980. He has lectured extensively in Australia and overseas, and the many exhibitions of his work have ranged from shows with commercial dealers and public museums, to major touring shows and retrospectives. The survey exhibition Peter Callas: Initialising History, Video Works, 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x9399 toured Australian museums in 2003. His work is held in the collections of numerous Australian museums including: National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, Art Gallery of NSW, Australian Centre of Contemporary Art, as well as in international collections including the Kunsthaus Zurich, Institute of Contemporary Art, London, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. \\\\nFrom: http://scanlines.net/node/1963\\\\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaZuPdmZ380SFUMKHVsv_AA/join\\\\n\\\\nLearn more about machine learning for image makers by signing up at https://mailchi.mp/da905fbd76ee/machine-learning-artists\\\\n\\\\nJoin the Artificial Images Slack channel: https://join.slack.com/t/ml-images/shared_invite/enQtNzU1MjAzMDQ2MjMwLTc4MTY3ZGM3MzAxNmE3MWYxNTQ0YmY4YTliZjNmMzUxMWQ4YThjZmU5Y2ZhOTU0ZjcxMDk3NWRlY2I0ZjlhOGU\\\\n\\\\nhttp://artificial-images.com/\\\\nhttps://www.patreon.com/bustbright\\\\nhttps://bustbright.com/\\\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dvsmethid/\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/dvsch\\\\nhttps://dvschultz.github.io/design/\"",

    "desc": "Between 1976 and 1982, Jane Veeder traveled the western mountains of the United States with Phil Morton. On these road trips the two would shoot video of their surroundings using a portable video recorder. Some of these video recordings of the western mountain terrain were used to produce the televised video piece known as Program #7. Program #7 was produced as a part of a larger group of videos known as The Electronic Visualization Center: A Television Research Satellite to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Program #7 was televised on Chicago Public Television as a part of a program which ran work by independent video creators. Program #7 was created using a Sandin Image Processor and a Bally Home Computer. Graphics generated using a Bally Home Computer would be overlaid overtop of the video recorded by Veeder and Morton using the Sandin Image Processor. The Sandin Image Processor would also be used to add varying patterns to the image.\\\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Veeder#Program_#7\\\\n\\\\nPhil Morton (1945\\xe2\\x80\\x932003) was an influential American video artist and activist who founded the Video Area in 1970 at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he taught for many years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Morton\\\\n\\\\nJane Veeder (born 1944) is an American digital artist, filmmaker and educator.
