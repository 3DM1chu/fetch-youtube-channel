A well-known example of a Demilitarised Zone is the border between North and South Korea.\\\\n \\\\nA DMZ, in computer terms, is similar. It\\'s an area of a network where security rules and policies are more relaxed.\\\\n\\\\nBut, why on earth would you want to relax security policies? \\\\n\\\\nWell, imagine you have a web server. You install it in your network just like all of your other devices.\\\\n\\\\nYou want people to access your web server and visit your website right? So you allow public access to your web server through your router and firewall.\\\\n\\\\nGreat, so now people can come and browse your website, www.example.com, and the request will be sent to your web server sitting inside your network.\\\\n\\\\nNow, this may seem fine, but it leaves you vulnerable to attacks. Web servers and websites are not bulletproof, and they require a lot of work to keep maintained, up-to-date and secure.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s say an attacker targets your website, and that attacker can get access to the web server itself. This is where the problems start.\\\\n\\\\nBecause our web server is installed alongside our other corporate servers and workstations, the attacker can now start to attack these machines from the web server. With a bit of luck, the attacker could gain access to the entire network. This is called lateral movement. \\\\n\\\\nFrom here, it\\'s really up to the attacker what they do next. It could be the exfiltration of your data or infecting your systems with ransomware, which will encrypt your data.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what is the solution?\\\\n\\\\nInstead of installing the web server in the corporate network, we can install it into its own network called a DMZ.\\\\n\\\\nA DMZ is created with two firewalls. The first firewall allows public access to our web server; the second firewall blocks public access.\\\\n\\\\nIf an attacker can access our web server, they may try to get lateral movement by attacking other machines in the network. Well, because we have separated this web server into its own network, there are no other machines to attack, and our second firewall blocks access to our corporate network.\\\\n\\\\nSo, while the web server has been compromised, the DMZ allows us to contain the attack to just that web server.\\\\n\\\\nThis dramatically reduces the cyber attack\\'s impact and makes the hacker sad. Meanwhile, the rest of the corporate network is unharmed and operating as normal.\"",

If you purchase using these links, I\\'ll receive a small commission at no extra charge to you. \\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\\\n\\\\n In this video, we break down the basic components of a wireless network.\\\\n\\\\nBasic Service Set\\\\nA Basic Service Set, or BSS, is where we have an access point connecting multiple devices, which are known as members of the BSS. \\\\n\\\\nMost wireless networks will connect back to the wired network. The upstream connection from the access point that connects back to the wired network is called the Distribution System or DS.\\\\n\\\\nBSSID and SSID\\\\nThe Access Point is periodically advertising the network details using radio waves. These advertisements are called beacon frame \\\\n\\\\nBeacon frames contain several bits of information, but the two main bits are the Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) and the Service Set Identifier (SSID)\\\\n\\\\nThe BSSID is a unique identifier for the wireless access point, and it\\'s based on the MAC address.\\\\n\\\\nThe SSID is something I\\'m sure you have seen and used before. It\\'s essentially the wireless network name.  \\\\n\\\\nExtended Service Set\\\\nFor bigger wireless networks, we often need to extend our wireless network using multiple access points. When we use multiple access points like this, it\\'s called an Extended Service Set. \\\\n\\\\nEach access point in an extended service set will have a unique BSSID to identify the device.\\\\n\\\\nThe same SSID, however, can be used on multiple access points to extend the range of the wireless network.\\\\n\\\\nRadio Frequencies\\\\nThe way our devices can talk to each other without the need for physical cables is by using electromagnetic waves. \\\\n\\\\nThis works by sending an alternating current into an antenna which creates magnetic fields that propagate out as waves.\\\\n\\\\nYou have probably heard of radio frequencies before, things such as radio and TV use radio frequencies.\\\\n\\\\nWireless uses two main frequency bands 2.4 and 5GHz\\\\n\\\\nChannels\\\\nNow to make things a bit more complicated, these bands are split into separate channels.\\\\n\\\\nIf we look at the 2.4 GHz band, which is actually 2.400 to 2.4835 GHz, we can see that it\\'s split into different channels.\\\\n \\\\nThe reason we use channels is to split the wireless bands into smaller, more management pieces allowing us to control things like congestion and interference. \\\\n\\\\nThe 2.4 GHz band has 14 channels, however a lot of these overlap which can cause interference. So instead, it is recommended to use channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid any problems. \\\\n\\\\nStandards\\\\nEverything we just looked at is part of the IEEE standard 802.11\\\\n\\\\nAs wireless technology evolves and improves, amendments to the 802.11 standard are made.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s important to note that for two devices to talk to each other, they both need to support the same amendments. Luckily, devices can be compatible with multiple amendments so you shouldn\\'t run into many problems.\"",

Well, behind every login page is access to confidential information or even administrator-level access. \\\\n\\\\nThis is gold dust for hackers! So as penetration testers or bug bounty hunters, it\\'s extremely valuable for us as well. \\\\n\\\\nSo how do we actually go about hacking a login page?\\\\n\\\\nThere are two main types of attacks we can use here. Brute forcing and dictionary attacks. \\\\n\\\\nA brute force attack is where you try every possible password that exists. For example, we might start with A, then AA, then AAA, then AAB, and so on and so on until the correct password is found.\\\\n\\\\nIn theory, this will eventually find the correct password, no matter what it is. However, the time it takes can vary greatly. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, finding a 5-character password with only lowercase letters could take seconds. A 16-character password with numbers, uppercase and special characters, however, could take millions of years! \\\\n\\\\nThis is why we use the second type of attack called a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is actually a type of brute force. \\\\n\\\\nBut instead of trying every possible combination of letters, numbers and symbols, we use a prebuilt list of possible passwords. \\\\n\\\\nUs humans are not as smart as we like to think! We tend to use passwords that are easy to type, easy to remember and even reuse that same password over and over again.\\\\n\\\\nSo we can use lists of passwords containing words, phrases and known passwords from past data breaches and there is a good chance we will find a match. \\\\n\\\\nLucky we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to type these passwords ourselves. There are plenty of tools we can use to do this for us. Probably the most popular one is called Hydra. \\\\n\\\\nHydra is a free tool used to hack logins, and it\\'s what we are going to use today.\"",

In this video, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to show you how to hack them!\\\\n\\\\nBefore we start hacking WordPress, we need to know a bit more about it. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve not heard of WordPress before, It\\'s the most popular way to create websites with little to no coding needed. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Content Management System also known as a CMS. A CMS is a tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, most web hosting providers provide an easy one-click installation of WordPress meaning literally anyone can start to create blogs, portfolios and business sites in a matter of minutes.   \\\\n\\\\nSome of the world\\'s biggest brands are using WordPress to run their websites. Sites such as TechCrunch, SonyMusic, and Disney\\\\n\\\\nSo that is the core WordPress application. From here, users will customise their websites. \\\\n\\\\nThe first thing people will usually do is install a custom theme. A theme changes the way your website is designed and looks. \\\\n\\\\nAfter installing a new theme, users can choose from a huge library of plugins. These plugins provide all kinds of features from contact forms to full-fledged e-commerce stores.\\\\n\\\\nSo these are the main components that make up a WordPress website, the core WordPress application, Themes and Plugins.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem with WordPress is it can be a nightmare to keep everything up to date and secure. But if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, very quickly vulnerabilities can be discovered in your plugins, themes and even WordPress itself! Then, attackers can use these vulnerabilities to hack the site. \\\\n\\\\nHTB Sponsor\\\\nHack the Box Academy has tons of free and premium training available, including this one on WordPress hacking.\\\\n\\\\nThey have a built-in, browser-based hacking machine and target WordPress server ready for us to hack so we don\\'t need to worry about installing it all ourselves.\"",

So it is widely supported.\\\\n\\\\nWhat traceroute does differently is instead of just telling us if a host can be reached or not, it also tells us every hop that was used to get to the destination host.\\\\n\\\\nA hop is every layer 3 device, typically routers, that our Traceroute message needs to pass through in order to get to the destination. \\\\n\\\\nThis can be really handy if you are trying to figure out which direction or which route your traffic is taking.\\\\n\\\\nThe way Traceroute collects a list of hops is pretty clever. It uses something called Time To Live or TTL.\\\\n\\\\nTTL is a method of limiting the lifespan of data. For IP packets, the TTL is a counter that decreases for every hop, that the data passes on its way to the destination. \\\\n\\\\nThis is where the magic of traceroute comes from.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s say we want to reach the Google DNS server 8.8.8.8. When we do a traceroute, our computer will send an ICMP request to 8.8.8.8, but with a TTL value of 1.\\\\n\\\\nThat means, that as soon as our request hits the first router, the TTL value will decrease to 0 and the request will be dropped.\\\\n\\\\nThe router will respond back to our host with a message saying \\xe2\\x80\\x98Time-to-live Exceeded\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\\\n\\\\nOur computer then does something clever. It takes note of the router\\'s IP address that just responded.\\\\n\\\\nIt then sends the same traceroute request, but this time with a TTL value of 2.\\\\n\\\\nSo now, our request hits the first router, decreases the TTL value to 1, and then passes it to the next router.\\\\n\\\\nAgain, the TTL value reaches 0 and the message is sent back to the sending computer where we can take note of the second hops IP address.\\\\n\\\\nAnd this process will continue until either it reaches the destination host, or the traceroute hits its maximum hops which is usually 30.\\\\n\\\\nPing Explained: https://youtu.be/7sv5pL-XgSg\"",

Sonar works by sending out sound waves and detecting any echoes reflected back by objects. Ping works in a similar way.     \\\\n \\\\nBy sending a receiving a successful ping, you can determine if a system is on the network, and most importantly, if you can reach it.    \\\\n\\\\nThere will be times when some, or none of the replies come back, and there are a few things that could cause this.\\\\n \\\\nRequest Timed Out\\\\nThen the most obvious cause of this error is that the system you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to reach doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t powered on, or isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connected to the network.   \\\\n \\\\nAnother reason why a system might not respond to a ping is due to the firewall.   \\\\n \\\\nDestination Host Unreachable\\\\nThis error generally indicates that a route to the destination cannot be found. This could be from the localhost or the default gateway.\\\\n \\\\nPing could not find the host\\\\nThis means your computer was unable to resolve the hostname to an IP address indicating a potential DNS server issue.\\\\n   \\\\nThat\\'s what happened when you have complete packet loss. Where things can get a bit more difficult to troubleshoot is when you only get partial packet loss, meaning some pings get replies but others don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.    \\\\n \\\\nThis can be caused by any number of things but generally, it means something is not behaving the way it should   \\\\n \\\\nSome examples are    \\\\nBroken network cards   \\\\nBroken cables   \\\\nProblems with the switches or routers   \\\\n \\\\nAnd this could be at any point between you and the machine you are trying to reach.   \\\\n \\\\nSo for that reason, complete packet loss is usually easier to troubleshoot.\"",

On-premise, or on-prem, refers to physical computers or servers in your office building.\\\\n\\\\nThis is how computing has traditionally been done. But this comes with several problems. On-prem servers are costly to purchase, maintain and replace. They\\'re also not easy to scale. Cloud computing can solve all of these problems for us and do much much more.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is cloud computing? Cloud computing, at its core, is moving your physical server, into someones else building. The idea behind cloud computing is that we can pay a company to provide us with the computing power we need, on a pay-as-you-go basis.\\\\n\\\\nCloud computing comes with several benefits. The upfront cost is also dramatically reduced. Instead of spending thousands upfront, we only pay for what we use. Because the cloud provider owns the servers, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to install, maintain or secure the hardware. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all done for us by the cloud provider. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also the benefit of scalability, cloud computing makes it very easy to scale up or down.\\\\n\\\\nCloud computing can be split into two categories, Private and Public.\\\\n \\\\nPrivate clouds describe everything we have already discussed, virtualisation, automation, scalability and redundancy, but this is owned and controlled by one organization for their internal use. For example, an enterprise may build its private cloud for its in-house development team to use.\\\\n \\\\nPublic cloud refers to public-facing companies that offer cloud computing as a service. Companies such as Azure, AWS and Linode are all public cloud companies.\\\\n \\\\nThe public cloud can also be categorised into the different types of services that are available. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), \\\\nSoftware as a service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS).\\\\n \\\\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) is probably the first thing that comes to most peoples minds when talking about cloud computing. It\\'s taking traditional computing, such as your computers, switches and routers, and hosting it in the cloud. \\\\n\\\\nSoftware as a service (SaaS) gives you access to the software or application only. The cloud provider takes take or the hardware, OS and everything else behind the scenes. Gmail, Office365, Salesforce, Dropbox are all considered Software as a service. \\\\n\\\\nPlatform as a service (PaaS) is focused on providing a platform where developers can build, deploy and scale their applications. It does this by providing on-demand, purpose-built environments without the need to think about the infrastructure sitting behind the scenes.\\\\n \\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it for cloud computing. You now have a solid understanding of what it is, how it works and the benefit of using it.\"",

An API request is just a simple HTTP message with some parameters telling the app what information to send back. This response will be sent back usually in JSON or XML format. \\\\n\\\\nThe beauty of APIs is that anyone can access information and features that would otherwise be unobtainable.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, most of us do not have access to a worldwide network of weather stations, but, anyone can build a mobile app and use APIs to request the data from the already existing weather application.\\\\n\\\\nAPIs have become so widespread, you would be hard-pressed to find a popular application these days that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t offer API access.\\\\n\\\\nWith this amount of access to APIs, the possibilities are endless.\"",

The idea is that the rogue DHCP server will assign IP address information but listing itself as the default gateway.

Its job is to ensure the safe delivery of data across public networks. By doing this, it allows users to send data as if they were connected directly to the private network.\\\\n\\\\nPrivate WAN technology is available however they come at a price. Internet VPNs however only require a very affordable internet connection. \\\\n\\\\nA VPN is often described as a tunnel. Your data is encrypted before it passes through the public internet. This way, if one of the bad guys does get their hands on your data, they can\\'t make any sense of it. Once your data is received, it is then decrypted using a special key so it can be read.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere are two main types of VPN. \\\\n\\\\nA site-to-site VPN connects two or more sites together. It needs to be configured on both networks, so it\\'s ideal in situations when you have multiple remote sites. \\\\n\\\\nBut you may also have individual users that work from home, coffee shops or anywhere else in the world. These users still require access to the corporate network, but a site-to-site VPN won\\'t work because you have no control over the networks they are connecting from. \\\\n\\\\nInstead, they can use a remote access VPN. A remote-access VPN grants access to the corporate network but only for one device, for example, a users laptop in a coffee shop. This is unlike the site-to-site VPNs which connects two entire networks. \\\\n\\\\nWhen configuring remote access VPNs, you need to decide if you want to use a \\'full tunnel\\' or a \\'split tunnel\\'. A full tunnel means that once connected to the VPN, all network traffic from this host will be forwarded to the corporate network. A split tunnel means only traffic destined for the corporate office is sent over the VPN. All other traffic is routed as normal.\\\\n\\\\nIPSec is a framework or set of rules for creating VPNs over a network.\\\\nIt does not define one way to create a VPN, but rather allows several protocols to be used for each VPN feature. IPSec is often used for site-to-site VPNs but it can also be used for remote access.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a local configuration file that\\'s checked.\\\\n\\\\nIf there are no cache entries, your computer will send a query to something called a DNS recursive resolver asking for the IP address of certbros.com.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the DNS resolver receives your query, it checks its cache. If it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find an entry for certbros.com, it will send a request to another server, this is called a ROOT server.\\\\n\\\\nThe root server will then refer us to the top-level domain server (TLD) for .com. A TLD server is a server that contains information for domains with a specific extension. For example .com .org .net etc \\\\n\\\\nThe TLD server will then refer us to the authoritative nameserver.\\\\n\\\\nThe authoritative nameservers will have a record for Certbros.com and it will return the IP address to our DNS Resolver which will then send it back to our computer. \\\\n\\\\nOut computer will now be able to contact the webserver using the newly discovered IP address. \\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

It\\'s a protocol used to transfer files across a network. \\\\n\\\\nFTP uses a client-server model. The server hosts the files and the client can connect, download files, upload files, delete files, rename files and list directories.\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few ways you can access an FTP server. \\\\n\\\\nThe first way is through a browser. You can type in the FTP server address. \\\\n\\\\nAnother way we can connect to an FTP server is via the windows file explorer. Again, we need to type the address into the bar at the top of the screen.\\\\n\\\\nThe third and the most popular way to access an FTP server is via an FTP client. Probably the most popular FTP client is called FileZilla.\\\\n\\\\nFTP uses transport protocol TCP. So like any other TCP protocol, the connection starts with a three-way handshake. Once we have completed our handshake, we have now opened a connection with the FTP server. \\\\n\\\\nFTP uses two different connections. This first one is the control connection. The control connection handles all of the FTP commands and instructions such as GET and PUT commands. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we want to start transferring files, a new connection is opened,\\\\nthis is called a data connection. There are two different types of data connections.\\\\n\\\\nActive data connections are established by the server initiating the session. It does this from a source port of 20 and uses a randomly generated dynamic destination port.\\\\n\\\\nPassive data connection are established by the client initiating the session, not the server. Randomly generated and agreed source and destination port numbers are used.\\\\n\\\\nBecause FTP was designed such a long time ago, it lacks even some of the most basic security features we see today, most notably, encryption. This means all communication between the FTP client and server is sent in cleartext. That includes login credentials.\\\\n\\\\nSo why would anyone use FTP if it has such a massive security flaw like plain text transmission? Well, you shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t! Instead, you should use something called FTPS instead. FTPS, also known as FTP Secure, is an extension to FTP adding a layer of security. FTPS uses TLS which is an encryption protocol used to keep our data safe and away from the prying eyes of hackers. \\\\n\\\\nOK, so the last type of FTP protocol I want to talk about is TFTP. Unlike FTPS which was an extension of FTP, TFTP goes back the other way. TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol and it\\'s pretty much a stripped back version of FTP. To keep it fast and lightweight, TFTP uses UDP port 69. It also doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any of the bells and whistles of standard FTP. \\\\n\\\\nTFTP can be very handy is in a local network for very basic transfers. You can use a TFTP server to quickly backup a Cisco iOS image or a configuration file for example. \\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

It has the very important job of synchronising clocks over a network.\\\\n\\\\nTime is one of those things that can easily be overlooked. In a network though, have inconsistent time, even just by a few minutes, can cause problems.\\\\n\\\\nEvery device on a network will have an internal clock. It\\'s important to keep accurate clocks, otherwise, you may run into issues with correlating logs, SSL certificates, software and the list goes on.\\\\n\\\\nThis is where NTP comes in. All of the network devices will sync their clocks to an NTP server which will have the accurate time.\\\\n \\\\nNTP uses a hierarchy system. At the very top, we have the big boys, the MacDaddies. These are highly accurate timekeeping devices such as atomic clocks, GPS or radio clocks. They are known as reference clocks.\\\\n\\\\nNTP uses stratum values to identify the accuracy of a clock.\\\\nStratum levels are between 0-15, with 0 being the most accurate and 15 being the least. Anything above 15 means the accuracy of the clock is not trustworthy.\\\\n\\\\nStratum 0 clocks do not connect over a network.\\\\nThey are directly connected to time servers. They then sync their time and date to the reference clock. These are known as Primary time servers.\\\\n\\\\nThe way the NTP stratum model works is by adding a 1 to stratum value at each layer. So, these primary time servers have a stratum 1 value. As we go further down the stratum hierarchy, the stratum value increases as the reference clock is further and further away meaning the time is less accurate.  \\\\n\\\\nNTP uses UDP port number 123. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice and easy to remember.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

It does this over UDP port 161 (Traps are received on port 162).\\\\n\\\\nThere are three versions of SNMP.\\\\n\\\\n - SNMPv1 which is the original version of SNMP\\\\n\\\\n - SNMPv2c \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This is the revised version which introduced some enhancements. Most notably the use of community strings for security. You can think of a community string like a password.\\\\n\\\\n - SNMPv3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Which is another improvement adding authentication and encryption. This version is much more secure than the previous versions.\\\\n\\\\nA device that is SNMP enabled is known as an agent. An SNMP agent has several objects that can be interacted with. Some objects are part of the industry standard, and some will be vendor-specific for this device.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, this router will have objects for, name, uptime, interfaces, and the routing table to name just a few.\\\\n\\\\nEach object is assigned an object identifier or OID. The OID is a sequence of numbers, which at first glance can look like an IP address. This is used to identify the object in a file called a MIB which stands for Management Information Base.\\\\n\\\\nTo interact with these object, we need something called a network management system or NMS. The NMS is a piece of software that can communicate with the SNMP agent.\\\\n\\\\nThere are a few ways the NMS can speak to the agent. The first way is by using GET requests. Get message include get, getNext and getBulk. They are used to actively request information from the agent.\\\\n\\\\nThe second way we can talk to an agent is by using SET requests. A set request is used to change a value on the agent.\\\\n\\\\nThe last method I want to talk about is Traps and Informs. Agents use traps and informs to actively communicate with the NMS. The agent can send a trap or inform to the NMS when an event occurs on the device.\\\\n\\\\nTraps and informs are two different types of massage but they both do the same thing. The difference is that informs are reliable. An inform message will wait for an acknowledgement from the NMS. If it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive one, it will resend the inform. A trap on the other hand is sent and then forgotten. Even though informs are consider reliable, both still use UDP. \\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

Why would you want to do that? Well, there are a few reasons why.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, Syslog information is very important when troubleshooting problems. Let\\'s say a user reports a network outage. You can go through all of the logs to see if there were any problems at the time the user reported the issue.\\\\n\\\\nAnother benefit of storing syslog information in a central place is data retention. Cisco devises, by default, stores log information in RAM. This means, when the device reboots, the logs are erased. Keeping all of your log information in one place allows for easy archiving.\\\\n\\\\nOK, so now we know what a syslog server is and why we use them, let\\'s look at some log messages! It may not seem like it straight away, but these messages follow an industry standard. This makes it easy to correlate logs from different vendors.\\\\n\\\\n- The first part is the timestamp or sequence number. You can choose which one you want to use.\\\\n\\\\n- The next part is called the facility. This shows the source of the message.\\\\n\\\\n- Next, we have the severity. This shows how urgent the log message is.\\\\n\\\\n- Then we have something call the mnemonic, this is a code to identify the message.\\\\n\\\\n- And finally, we have the description, which contains the log message.\\\\n\\\\nSyslog has 8 severity levels ranging from 0-7. The top is the most urgent, severity 0, and the bottom is the least urgent, which is 7 for debug messages. This is important because you likely don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to send all syslog messages to your server.\\\\n\\\\n0 Emergency \\\\n1 Alert\\\\n2 Critical \\\\n3 Error\\\\n4 Warning \\\\n5 Notice \\\\n6 Informational \\\\n7 Debug\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, this is one of those tables you\\'re going to have to memorise for the CCNA exam. You need to know, not only the severity levels but which order they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in. As with most of these things, mnemonics come to the rescue.\\\\n\\\\nEvery Awesome Cisco Engineer Will Need Ice-cream Daily\\\\nErnie Always Cries Even when No one is Dying\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

There are a few reasons why we might want to use VLANs. One of the main reasons is something we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already spoken about, and that is broadcast traffic.\\\\n\\\\nVery quickly, broadcast traffic came start to slow down our networks and devices. Once our networks start to grow, we need a way to manage all of this traffic.\\\\n\\\\nVLANs give us the benefits of physically separating network, but with the added bonus of being able to do this virtually. The traffic still behaves in the same way as if it was physically split.\\\\n\\\\nVLANs make it very easy to control broadcast domains. It\\'s also scalable, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need new equipment or to re-cable everything every time we want to make a change.\\\\n \\\\nOut of the box, cisco, and most over switches, have a default VLAN called VLAN 1. Every interface is assigned the default VLAN.\\\\n\\\\nFrom here, we can start to make our own VLANs and split up our switch. You can add up to 4094. This is the maximum number of supported VLANs.\\\\n\\\\nVLANs aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t restricted to just one switch. We can have the same VLANs across multiple switches. This makes VLANs very versatile and scalable.\\\\n\\\\nThere are two types of ports on a switch, an access port and a trunk port. An access port is designed for endpoint devices to access the network. Such as computers, laptops etc.\\\\n\\\\nA trunk port can send traffic from different VLANs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re are used to send traffic between networking devices.\\\\n\\\\n802.1q tags are added to frames when they are sent over a trunk port. 802.1q is the IEEE standard. It can also be called DOT1q. This tag is 4 bytes and contains a few bits of information.\\\\n\\\\nTPID or Tag protocol Identifier \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is used to identify the frame as an 802.1q tagged frame. It could also be ISL but this it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rarely used today. \\\\n\\\\nTCI or Tag Control Information \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This contains 3 bits of information, the priority, CFI, which is a format indicator, and most importantly, the VLAN ID.\\\\n\\\\nThe tag field is then read and removed by the receiving switch.\\\\n \\\\nA native VLAN is configured per trunk interface. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the VLAN that switch assumes the frame is on if there is no tag. By default, the native VLAN is VLAN 1. Tags are not added to frames that belong to the native VLAN.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

Firewalls are designed to shield and protect our trusted networks from the untrusted. \\\\n \\\\nThe idea is that a firewall will block all the bad traffic from the attackers.\\\\nWhile at the same time, allow normal flow for the good traffic. \\\\n \\\\nMost firewall, by default, block everything!\\\\n \\\\nIt doesn\\'t matter if its traffic leaving the network or traffic entering the network. Everything is blocked. \\\\n \\\\nThe way we allow traffic to pass the firewall without being block is by adding firewall rules.\\\\n\\\\nNext-gen firewalls take the same methods but then enhances them with more in-depth security features.\\\\n \\\\nGenerally speaking, this is what a next-generation firewall should include. \\\\n \\\\nApplication Level Inspection: So the firewall can identify and block risky application traffic.\\\\n \\\\nIntrusion Prevention Systems or IPS: IPS will inspect the contents of the traffic and look for patterns or signatures of malicious or malware related traffic. \\\\n \\\\nExternal Threat Intelligence: Next-generation firewalls can update themselves from external threat intelligence sources. \\\\n \\\\nComputers can also have software-based firewalls. For example, the windows firewall is built-in and uses the same rule-based methods. Such as port, destination, and source IP addresses.\\\\n \\\\nHaving a firewall both on the network and the endpoints is important when creating a layer security posture. \\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

MAC stands for Media Access Control. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a unique identifier that is assigned to a network interface card, aka a NIC.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what a MAC address looks like 08-00-27-EC-10-61. Its a 48-bit (6-byte) address that is used for layer 2 communication. \\\\n\\\\nThe first thing to note is that unlike IP addresses, which and can be changed, MAC addresses are burnt into NIC buy the manufacture.\\\\n\\\\nA MAC address has 2 sections. The first 24-bits is called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and it identifies the vendor. The last 24-bits is a unique value assigned by the vendor. The result is an address that should be unique in the world.\\\\n\\\\nThere are three types of Mac address\\\\nUnicast - A unique mac address assigned to an interface\\\\nMulticast - An address used to send traffic to a device using a particular application/protocol.\\\\nBroadcast - An address that is sent to all devices within a local network. \\\\n\\\\nWhy do we need MAC addresses? When are computers are talking on the local area network or LAN, they use layer 2 communication, and layer 2 communication uses MAC addresses. When we leave our network, this is when the IP addresses are used. Routers are layer 3 devices and they mainly focus on IP addresses to get the data to the destination.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

This means the address is made up of 32 binary digits. Each digit is called a bit. The IP address contains 4 octets. Each octet contains 8 binary bits.\\\\n\\\\nEach bit can either be a 1 or a 0. A bit represents a value of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128. That value doubles in size from right to left. This is called the power of 2.\\\\n\\\\nWe also need to think about subnet masks. Previously I said, wherever there is 255, this is the network section and wherever there is a 0, this is the host section. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true in the simplest form, however, it can get a bit more complicated than that.\\\\n\\\\nThe real way to see which part of an IP address is the network section is by looking at the subnet mask binary bits and comparing it to the IP address binary bits. Anytime you see a 1 value, this bit is the network section and anytime you see a 0 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the host section.\\\\n\\\\nInstead of the full subnet mask, you will often see it written as a forward slash, and then the number of network binary bits. For example, instead of 255.255.255.0, we could write it as /24. This is usually added to the end of the IP address.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

For the postal service to work, every house needs to have its own, unique address. If you need to send a letter, you\\'ll need to write the destination address on the envelope. That way, when you send your letter, the postman knows exactly where to deliver it. \\\\n \\\\nComputers work in the same way. Each computer in a network needs to have a unique address, called an IP address.\\\\nand when sending data to a computer, just like letters, we need to add the destination address. We also need to include a return address, so they know where to reply. \\\\n \\\\nAn IPv4 address is 32-bits in length. It contains 4 sections, which are called octets. These octets are separated by periods. Each octet can, in theory, contain any number between 0 - 255\\\\n\\\\nThe IP address is separated into two parts. The first part represents the network and the second part represents the host. To know which part of an IP address represents the network, we use something called a subnet mask. In its simplest form, wherever you see 255. this is the network part of the address and wherever you see a zero, this is the host part of the address,\\\\n \\\\nIP Address Classes\\\\nIt was decided to split all of the available addresses into groups called classes. The idea was to make address allocation scalable.\\\\nWe have class A, class B, and class C. Class D and E are reserved. \\\\n\\\\nClass A addresses are between 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255\\\\n 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.0 are class A addresses but are reserved \\\\nWith a subnet mask of 255.0.0.0\\\\nMax Hosts: 16,777,214\\\\n\\\\nClass B addresses are between 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255\\\\nWith a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0\\\\nMax Hosts: 65,534\\\\n\\\\nand class C addresses are between 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255\\\\nWith a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0\\\\nMax Hosts:254 \\\\n \\\\nPrivate IP Addresses\\\\n\\\\nBut there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem. The problem is that no one could have predicted the massive explosion of computers and the internet. In fact, there are no more unallocated Ipv4 addresses left. That is why the new Ipv6 has been designed to give us more than enough IP addresses for everyone.\\\\n\\\\nTo help prolong the life of IPv4, we have carved out a small section from all three classes and called them, private IP addresses.\\\\n\\\\nPrivate class A addresses are between 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255\\\\nPrivate class B addresses are between 172.16.0.0 - 172.32.255.255\\\\nPrivate class C addresses are between 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

Layer 4 is also responsible for choosing port numbers.\\\\n\\\\nSo why do we need port numbers? The example I give here is the postal service. To get post, you install a letterbox (at least here in the UK). This letterbox allows the postal service to access your home.\\\\n\\\\nNetwork applications work in the same way. If you want to communicate over a network, you must allow some means of access to your device. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s say we want to access a web server. We type in the web address (also known as a URL) of the site we want to visit.\\\\n\\\\nThe first thing the computer does it convert that URL to an IP address.\\\\nThis is done by using DNS, but we will cover than in another video. For now, just know it coverts web addresses to IP addresses.\\\\n\\\\nThe computer then sends the request to the webserver. The server will then look at the destination port to find out which application to send this data to. It can do this because there is a standard that port numbers follow. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we made our web request, our computer knew we were trying to access a HTTP site. So it added the destination port number 80 to the TCP header.\\\\n\\\\nThe computer will also choose a randomly generated source port to receive reply\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral port numbers are called well-known ports. These are common protocols that have been assigned port numbers.\\\\nExamples of well-known port numbers are HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SMTP (25).\\\\n\\\\n0 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1023: Well-known port numbers. \\\\n1024 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 49151: Registered ports that companies have registered IANA\\\\n49152-65535: Dynamic ports\\\\n\\\\nResources:\\\\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6335\\\\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

That choice comes down to reliable or unreliable transmission.\\\\n\\\\nBoth reliable and unreliable have their benefits and drawbacks. \\\\n\\\\nTCP (Transmission control protocol) is the most widely chosen option for transmitting data. This is because it can reliably send and receive data. \\\\n\\\\nThe way TCP can provide such stable and reliable connections is in three ways.\\\\n\\\\n1. Acknowledgements\\\\n2. Sequencing\\\\n3. Checksum\\\\n\\\\nBut, before any of that can happen, first we need to start a reliable connection.\\\\nTCP does this by using what\\'s called a three-way handshake. \\\\n\\\\n1. SYN\\\\n2. SYN-ACK \\\\n3. ACK\\\\n\\\\nNow we have an open TCP connection. A similar process will be followed when closing this connection as well.\\\\n\\\\nUDP (User Datagram Protocol) has none of the error handling, sequencing or reliability of TCP.\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of UDP as a kind of machine gun of data. Just firing and firing not caring if data is lost or not. \\\\n\\\\nWhile TCP offers great connection and reliability, it comes at a price or resource and latency.\\\\n\\\\nWhere UDP is very useful is in a situation when we need live, real-time connections. For example, voice calls, video calls, and gaming all need fast real-time connections. \\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it for the TCP and UDP, two ways to send data, for two different purposes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you liked this video, don\\'t forget to like, comment and subscribe.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

This will contain every subnet within the entire network!\\\\n\\\\nUpdates everywhere!\\\\nOSPF is great at responding to changes, however in such a large network problem can occur. Every router will need to reevaluate all routes and run the SPF algorithm anytime a change occurs, even if that change is as small as a network cable being unplugged. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure you can imagine the work load required in a large network. \\\\n\\\\nThe solution!\\\\nOSPF multi areas is designed to segments your network and allows routers to summarise routes between the areas reducing the problems mentioned above. \\\\n\\\\nDesigning OSPF multi areas takes some planning to get the full benefit. \\\\n\\\\nEach area should contain subnets that can be summarised. \\\\n\\\\nAll areas must connect to the backbone area/Area 0\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

That\\'s not a problem if you have two or three switches, but it can become very time consuming when you have a few more.\\\\n\\\\nVTP solves this issue by allowing all switches (within the VTP domain) to sync their VLANs together in a VLAN database. The goal is to have every switch running the same version of the VLAN database.\\\\n\\\\nThe switches do this by sending different messages to each other. These messages allow them to update, maintain and synchronise their VLAN databases.\\\\n\\\\nTypes of Message\\\\n------------------------------\\\\nSummery Advertisement\\\\n\\\\nThese messages are sent to let all the switches know the current revision number of the VLAN database\\\\n\\\\n-Domain name\\\\n-Password\\\\n-Revision number\\\\n-Followers\\\\n\\\\nSubset Advertisement\\\\n\\\\nThese messages contain VLAN information so the other switches can add them to their own database.\\\\n\\\\n-Domain name\\\\n-Revision number\\\\n-VLAN info\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement Request\\\\n\\\\nThese messages are sent when a switch needs to request a Subset Advertisement to sync it\\'s database.\\\\n\\\\nRequirements\\\\n------------------------------\\\\nThere are some requirements that need to be met before the switches will sync their VLAN databases.\\\\n\\\\n-Be in the same VTP domain\\\\n-Have the same VTP password if set\\\\n-Connect over a trunk\\\\n\\\\nModes\\\\n------------------------------\\\\nThere are three different modes that can be used.\\\\n\\\\nServer\\\\n-Can create VLANs\\\\n-Can send updates\\\\n\\\\nClient\\\\n-Cannot create VLANs\\\\n-Can send updates\\\\n\\\\nTransparent\\\\n-Can only create local VLANs\\\\n-Does not send updates\\\\n-Does forward updates from other switches\\\\n\\\\nVTP Pruning\\\\n------------------------------\\\\nPruning is a feature of VTP that can helps prevent unnecessary traffic from being sent to switches with no ports on a particular VLAN.

By using NAT you can convert all your private IP addresses to a single (or few) public address. This means a huge number of public addresses can be saved because the private addresses can be used over and over again in private networks across the world.\\\\n\\\\nTypes of NAT\\\\nThere are three types of NAT, some more common than others but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good idea to know exactly how each one works and how they can be used.\\\\n\\\\nStatic\\\\nStatic NAT is when you manually assign each private IP address + port number a public IP address + port number. This could be used when running web server or mail serve.\\\\n\\\\nDynamic\\\\nThe way Dynamic NAT works is by assigning each private IP to a public IP from a manually created pool of available public addresses.\\\\nYou can use this to merge two networks with the same subnet together. You would configure the connecting routers to make the subnets appear to be different to what they actually are.\\\\n\\\\nPAT (Overload)\\\\nPort Address Transaction (PAT) or Overload as it is often called is the most popular version used today.\\\\nThe way PAT works is it converts the private address + port number to the public address + port number.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

The model was introduced to standardize networks in a way that allowed multi-vendor systems, prior to this you would only be able to have a one vendor network as the devices could not communicate with other vendor devices.\\\\n\\\\nThe Layers\\\\n\\\\nApplication (layer 7)\\\\n\\\\nThis layer is where the application and user communicates. Application specific protocols are used here such as SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) for sending emails from Outlook.\\\\n\\\\nPresentation (layer 6)\\\\n\\\\nThis layer formats the data in a way that the receiving application can understand it. This layer is also able to encrypt and decrypt date if needed.\\\\n\\\\nSession (layer 5)\\\\n\\\\nThis layer is responsible for establishing and terminating of connections between devices.\\\\n\\\\nTransport (layer 4)\\\\n\\\\nThe transport layer of OSI Model is used for error handling and sequencing to unsure no data is lost. This layer also adds source and destination port numbers\\\\n\\\\nNetwork (layer 3)\\\\n\\\\nThe network layer handles IP address routing. At this stage of the OSI model the source and destination IP address is added to the data.\\\\n\\\\nData Link (layer 2)\\\\n\\\\nAt this layer the physical address (MAC Address) is added to the data, this includes the source and destination MAC address.\\\\n\\\\nPhysical (layer 1)\\\\n\\\\nThe physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model. Its key responsibility is to carry the data across the physical hardware such as an Ethernet cable to the destination.\\\\n\\\\nThis video is designed to give a basic and general overview of the OSI model. Its aim is to simplify the concept to make it easier to understand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

We will see how they work and what they are used for. \\\\n\\\\nHubs\\\\n\\\\nHubs were around before switches. A Hubs job is to forward traffic from the source device to the destination device.\\\\n\\\\nA hub is a layer 1 (physical layer) device which means that is does not understand MAC or IP addresses. This is a problem. Because the hub does not know where the destination device is located, it will send traffic out of all ports (except the receiving port) causing collisions and queues which results in packet loss and delays.\\\\n\\\\nDue to the horrific down falls, hubs have been replaced with switches almost everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nBridges\\\\n\\\\nBridges are used to separate a LAN network in to segments so that traffic is not sent between them. They work by using layer 2 (data link later) to identify the where traffic should be sent. Now it is worth noting that bridges will send traffic out all ports until it learns (using MAC address) where each port leads.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSwitches\\\\n\\\\nYou could think of a switch as the heart of a network, pumping blood (traffic) around the body (network). All Devices will connect to the switch and it is the switches job to send the traffic to the correct place. Now unlike a hub, a switch can learn the mac addresses of each port using a Mac Address Table and can also send and receive at the same tine which means no more collisions or delays.\\\\n\\\\nRouters\\\\n\\\\nWe have all heard of them and most likely everyone you know will have one in their home. If your reading this on a computer then I bet there is one right next to you. \\\\n\\\\nA router connects your LAN to other networks such as the internet. If your house was a LAN network, your door would be the router. It is the way \\xe2\\x80\\x98outside\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of your network.\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

For example, you might not want one of the companies employees plugging in a virus ridden personal laptop in to the corporate network and infecting everyone with god knows what!\\\\n\\\\nWith Port Security, you have a couple of options. You can set a maximum number of devices (mac addresses) or you can staticly tell the switch witch mac address to accept. Now the first option might be to stop people from plugging in switch upon switches and the second might be used to stop any other devices connected all together.\\\\n\\\\nPort Security is a topic on the CCENT exam and its important to know what it is and how to configure it. The best advise is to follow this video through, then some other settings to see how it reacts.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",

It uses a very clever process that encrypts and decrypts the data that is sent, you can read more on how it is done here http://coplex.co.uk/cisco/how-to-configure-ssh/ \\\\n\\\\nSSH does have a few extra steps involved but still only takes a few minutes to set up as this videos shows you. \\\\n\\\\nThis video uses a Cisco 3550 Switch however the process is the same for switches and routers.\\\\n\\\\nIf you like the video please like, comment, subscribe\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#ccna #cisco #networking\"",
