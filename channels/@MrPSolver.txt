    "desc": "For the first podcast of this channel, I interview my old MSc supervisor, Dr. Michel Lefebvre.  He is Professor of Physics at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada.  His research interests and contributions focus on the exploration of the laws of nature using proton collisions at the highest available energies.  He is a founding member of the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and acted as founding Spokesperson of the ATLAS Canada Collaboration in 1992.  He remains very active in research and teaching.\"",

I look specifically at 1. Fourier Transforms, 2. Fourier Series, and 3. The Discrete Fourier Transform. Some of these transforms involve integrals that can be evaluated analytically (i.e. integrals can be solved symbolically using sympy) while other transforms involve integrals don\\'t have analytic solutions: numerical solutions can be obtained for such integrals using scipy. \\\\n\\\\nFourier Transforms show up in fields such as quantum mechanics when one wishes to convert a wavefunction in a position basis to a momentum basis. If the analytical form of the wavefunction is known, this transition is seamless using scipy or sympy. Fourier series can often show up in the study of partial differential equations. Finally, the discrete Fourier transform is a useful tool in data analysis to obtain a spectral density estimator for a given time series, for example.\\\\n\\\\nLink to code\\\\nhttps://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/blob/main/Python%20Tutorial%20Series/fourier_transform1.ipynb\\\\n\\\\nDiscord Server\\\\nhttps://discord.com/invite/hTBzC9RNZX\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2:46 1 .Fourier Transforms (Function Domain Unbounded)\\\\n8:35 2.
