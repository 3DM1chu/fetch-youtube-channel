In this episode of Cyber Weapons Lab, we\\'re showing how to configure a router so that you can access those services and tools from the broader internet. \\\\n\\\\nPorts are channels that computers use to communicate with each other. A certain port may be using a certain protocol, like SSH, which is usually assigned to port 22. If you\\'ve ever had a Raspberry Pi, and wanted to connect to it from your laptop, then you might have set it up on the local network and SSHed in. You\\'d pull up a terminal on your laptop, and use something like the local IP and your port, and the login credentials, to gain access to your SSH shell on the Pi.\\\\n\\\\nNow, if you\\'re not on your local network, but you still want to access your Raspberry Pi that\\'s still on your local network, that\\'s where port forwarding comes into play.\\\\n\\\\nYour ISP provides one public IP to the router at your home, and that router is blocking all those ports from coming in and out of your house. Port forwarding is a rule that lets the router know that an incoming port to your public IP needs to be sent to a specific IP on your local network with this particular port. Ports don\\'t have to match, like 9022 coming to public IP, then out to the Pi at port 22. Once set up, you could remotely connect to the Pi from a non-local network.\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTo learn more, check out the article: https://nulb.app/x48k8\\\\n\\\\nFollow Null Byte on:\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nullbyte\\\\nFlipboard: https://flip.it/3.Gf_0\\\\nWebsite: https://null-byte.com\\\\nWeekly newsletter: https://eepurl.com/dE3Ovb\\\\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/channels/nullbyte\"",

We\\'ll demonstrate how bad actors can use am evil twin attack to steal Wi-Fi passwords. Essentially, they kick a user off their trusted network while creating a nearly identical fake one they connect to. This forces the victim to connect to the fake network and supply the Wi-Fi password to regain internet access.\\\\n\\\\nWhile a more technical user might spot this attack, it\\'s surprisingly effective against those not trained to look for suspicious network activity. The reason it\\'s so successful is that most users don\\'t know what a real firmware update looks like, leading to confusion in recognizing that an attack is in progress. By knowing all this, it\\'s easier to spot and avoid your Wi-Fi password from being taken right from under you.\\\\n\\\\nTo learn more, check out the article and more in-depth video on our website: https://nulb.app/x4a3p\\\\n\\\\nFollow Null Byte on:\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nullbyte\\\\nFlipboard: https://flip.it/3.Gf_0\\\\nWebsite: https://null-byte.com\\\\nWeekly newsletter:  https://eepurl.com/dE3Ovb\\\\nVimeo: https://vimeo.com/channels/nullbyte\"",

On this episode of Cyber Weapons Lab, we\\'ll show you how to create and manipulate packets with a Python tool called Scapy.\\\\n\\\\nThis is just a quick example of how a hacker could use Scapy to craft packets that allow them to stay under the radar even when they\\'re doing things on a network that they\\'re connected to. Because Scapy allows us to build packets from scratch, it means we can get as creative as we want. If we want to kick someone off the network while not being so obvious it was us, we can simply create fake packets that say that the router is the one kicking them off. We can also run a network scan by simply pretending to be the router sending out ARP requests getting everybody to reply and just sitting back and listening for those replies with Wireshark. It\\'s really easy to use Scapy for a variety of different creative things, and the more you learn about TCP/IP, the more useful it will be for your hacking endeavors.\\\\n\\\\nFollow Null Byte on:\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nullbytewht\\\\nFlipboard: https://flip.it/3.Gf_0\\\\nWeekly newsletter:  https://eepurl.com/dE3Ovb\"",

This is commonly HTTP rather than HTTPS, and most people don\\'t really bother to make the distinction or prefer to buy one that\\'s secure because they don\\'t understand the risk that it poses.\\\\n\\\\nNow, on a network that has security, like a WPA network that has passwords, if you just have one person on the network, you\\'re probably going to be okay if you have a pretty strong password and nobody can see the traffic that\\'s going through it.\\\\n\\\\nBut the second somebody else gets your password or if it\\'s on an open or shared network, then you can really start to get in trouble because anybody can see these insecure HTTP requests over the network.\\\\n\\\\nWhat this boils down to is we can actually see what the person is seeing on their screen, so if they\\'re watching the security camera or if they have a dedicated monitor set up to watch it somewhere in their business or home, then we can literally just download the packets as they\\'re transferring from one device to another, and then use Wireshark to export them and look at them on our screen.\\\\n\\\\nFollow Null Byte on:\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nullbytewht\\\\nFlipboard: https://flip.it/3.Gf_0\\\\nWeekly newsletter:  https://eepurl.com/dE3Ovb\"",
