I\\'m going to enable channel merchandise to sell relevant t-shirts that designers and/or coders will find interest in. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s more info and rules:\\\\n\\\\n1. Starts today, ends Wednesday, June 19th\\\\n\\\\n2. You can submit multiple entries. There may be multiple winners.\\\\n\\\\n3. Has to be relevant based on design or coding. I\\'m looking for well-executed design. Something unique, witty / clever. Something other designers and developers would want. I don\\'t need my channel branding on it, it doesn\\'t have to be specific to my channel at all. (See the video for examples of what I\\'m talking about)\\\\n\\\\n4. It has to be original. I will do my own search to be sure the idea wasn\\'t copied from someone else.\\\\n\\\\n5. You will get paid $75 if I like your entry, preferably via paypal.\\\\n\\\\n6. You give me the rights to use the design and sell it as I wish (non-exclusive, you can sell it too).\\\\n\\\\n7. You have to include a vector file for your concept. You should also convert any fonts to outlines, so that I don\\'t need the particular font to open it.\\\\n\\\\n8. I may also make adjustments design-wise to the concepts if I want to use them.  In fact, I may entirely scrap your design, but keep the idea or concept and redesign it as I wish.. but you will still get paid for the idea.\\\\n\\\\n9. I will announce the winners on a YouTube community post and inside my discord server. If there\\'s enough GOOD winners, I will release a YouTube video featuring them.\\\\n\\\\n10. There will definitely be at least 1 winner. So I\\'m really hoping one of you comes through with a great design!\\\\n\\\\nSUBMIT HERE! \\\\nhttps://www.cognitoforms.com/DesignCourse1/DesignCourseShirtDesignCompetition\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe for NEW VIDEOS!\\\\n\\\\nMy site:                                 https://designcourse.com\\\\nMy personal FB account:   http://fb.com/logodesigner\\\\nCoursetro FB:                       http://fb.com/coursetro\\\\nCoursetro\\'s Twitter:             http://twitter.com/designcoursecom\\\\n\\\\nJoin my Discord!                https://discord.gg/a27CKAF\\\\n^-Chat with me and others\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nWho is Gary Simon?

Sure, you clearly know and SEE what a great design looks like from the top designers on sites like Dribbble and Behance, but why can\\'t you produce them?\\\\n\\\\nIn this course, I\\'m going to help answer that question and provide you with a blueprint that\\'s going to speed up your transition from producing ugly UI\\'s as a beginner, to producing fantastic UI\\'s. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, we\\'re going to spend some time discussing the very important design fundamentals that you need to understand before you can start designing UI\\'s. Then, we\\'ll step into a design and prototyping app (Adobe XD, it\\'s free! https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) and design a beautiful UI from scratch. While doing this, I\\'m going to describe exactly what\\'s going through my mind as I piece together a UI. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s get started!\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe for NEW VIDEOS!\\\\n\\\\nMy site:                                 https://designcourse.com\\\\nMy personal FB account:   http://fb.com/logodesigner\\\\nCoursetro FB:                       http://fb.com/coursetro\\\\nCoursetro\\'s Twitter:             http://twitter.com/designcoursecom\\\\n\\\\nJoin my Discord!                https://discord.gg/a27CKAF\\\\n^-Chat with me and others\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nWho is Gary Simon?

It\\'s a 5 step, sequential process that I formulated that I feel would make the process of going from an absolute beginner to a pretty solid frontend dev by the end of 2019 and beyond.\\\\n\\\\nTechnically, I\\'m mixing two job roles into one by suggesting frontend developers should start with design. However, I personally think the two are so closely related that they should become one. A UI designer who lacks frontend development knowledge might make the mistake of designing UI\\'s that just aren\\'t achievable or efficient in code.  A frontend developer who lacks design knowledge won\\'t be able to identify problematic areas in a mockup/prototype provided to him.  Also, if you\\'re a one man show freelancer, understanding ui/ux and frontend dev is a necessity!\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s get started!\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe for NEW VIDEOS!\\\\n\\\\nMy site:                                 https://designcourse.com\\\\nMy personal FB account:   http://fb.com/logodesigner\\\\nCoursetro FB:                       http://fb.com/coursetro\\\\nCoursetro\\'s Twitter:             http://twitter.com/designcoursecom\\\\n\\\\nJoin my Discord!                https://discord.gg/a27CKAF\\\\n^-Chat with me and others\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nWho is Gary Simon?

There have been 168 days and this is video #169.  I\\'m on par to reach that goal, but I\\'m opting out for a few very important reasons; the most of which being *QUALITY*\\\\n\\\\nSome have mentioned that my videos are already of high quality, and that\\'s nice!  But I\\'m fully confident that I can provide tutorials that are of a much, much higher caliber in terms of quality, projects and production.  This will ultimately prove to be a positive for everyone involved, instead of these *forced* videos that are pushed out, some of which largely due to the fact that I set an arbitrary goal.  In many cases, I had absolutely no clue what I was going to record within an hour of recording them.  Not exactly a fun position to be in, and not exactly a position that\\'s conducive to quality.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m not quitting the goal because I\\'m slacking, or because I want to do something else.  In fact it\\'s quite the opposite.  I\\'m more dedicated than ever and because of that, I want to ensure that every video I put out is fantastic.\\\\n\\\\nSo get ready for DesignCourse 2.0: QUALITY and overall BADASS-ED-NESS (or something).\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe for NEW VIDEOS weekly!\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMy site:                                 https://designcourse.com\\\\nMy personal FB account:   http://fb.com/logodesigner\\\\nCoursetro FB:                       http://fb.com/coursetro\\\\nCoursetro\\'s Twitter:             http://twitter.com/designcoursecom\\\\n\\\\nJoin my Discord!                https://discord.gg/a27CKAF\\\\n^-Chat with me and others\\\\n\\\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\\\n\\\\nWho is Gary Simon?
