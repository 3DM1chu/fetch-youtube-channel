The other strange thing is, if you use the sizes attribute, you are actually going to be including media queries in your html... which is kind of strange.

To understand how the viewBox works though, the first thing we need to do is understand what the SVG viewport is. \\\\n\\\\nThe viewport is sort of like our browser window. A website is larger than our browser window, which is why we have to scroll. SVGs are a bit like that too, we have a viewport that allows us to look at the SVG canvas. That viewport is the size of the SVG in our code, but the SVG canvas can be much larger!\\\\n\\\\nThe SVG viewBox is different. This is what we use to zoom in and out and pan around. The viewport stays the same. Picture opening something in Photoshop, then zooming in and panning around. You aren\\'t changing the size of your Photoshop window at all (that\\'s the viewport), but instead your moving items around on your screen (moving around the viewBox).\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nI have a newsletter! https://www.kevinpowell.co/newsletter\\\\n\\\\nNew to Sass, or want to step up your game with it?

The problem is, it isn\\'t responsive and is a bit old school in that it uses floats. \\\\n\\\\n***** An important note, I\\'ve edited the CodePen a few times since publishing this. One is to not use `all: unset;` which Edge doesn\\'t support. Another edit, which I talk more about lower in the description, was to make it tab-able *****\\\\n\\\\nIn this video, I take that same navigation but I update it to take advantage of modern CSS, making it fixed top, adding a semi-transparent background, creating the dropdown without any javascript, using flexbox and CSS grid to lay it out, and changing up the pseudo-element transitions to be higher performance.\\\\n\\\\nA commenter kindly pointed out that this isn\\'t tabbable, which is an issue and causes accessibility issues. I\\'ve updated my CodePen to take this into account. Basically, I changed the \\'display: none\\' on the input, which makes it almost useless, to instead have a position absolute on it and moved it way off screen. Then, I made it so when the input gains focus, the label gets highlighted to give us a visual clue as well.

Just remembering which number is which line can be annoying. Luckily, we can name our lines, which just makes life a lot better!\\\\n\\\\nIn this video I create a relatively simple layout using the grid, and then use line names to make it a lot easier to use. While the layout is simple, it\\'s totally something that you could use in one of your projects.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of making it easier to remember which line is which, it\\'s super easy to do! The only draw back is, as of the time that I put this video up, Sass can\\'t compile if we use line names, so if you\\'re using the CSS Grid and really want some line names, you\\'ll have to write some vanilla CSS. I realize this is a pretty big drawback for some (myself included), but it\\'s such a cool feature I had to talk about it.\\\\n\\\\nYou can play with my code on CodePen here: https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/QMGoBO\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAlso, I just found a solution to using line names in Sass (YAY!) - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43206860/named-css-grid-lines-with-scss\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/kevinpowell\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m on some other places on the internet too!\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'d like a behind the scenes and previews of what\\'s coming up on my YouTube channel, make sure to follow me on Instagram and Twitter.\\\\n\\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kevinpowell.co/\\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell\\\\nCodepen: https://codepen.io/kevinpowell/\\\\nGithub: https://github.com/kevin-powellom/KevinJPowell\"",
