Understand \\\\u0026 Define The problem: Understand the problem first and then define it clearly and you are ready now  \\\\n2. Prepare your data:  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about your data, make sure it ready for the real problems\\\\n3. Choosing right method: You will not get it right at first time, still you need something to be on right track\\\\n4. Applying Baseline Approach: Use subset of the problem and use simple estimator to get feet wet\\\\n5. Using Appropriate Architecture: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like selecting adequate weapon depending to the fight you are in    \\\\n6. Appropriate Training Strategy: Choose the best fit training strategy and apply hyperparameter tuning\\\\n7. Stop Overfitting with Regularization: Build real learning solution, not the one which cheat through learning\\\\n8. Enhance through Augmentation: Add various data into the mix to enhance your results\\\\n9. Add Model Interpretability: Stay away from Black box results by adding proper model understanding\\\\n10.

You will also develop the consumers purchase history from each Walmart store location in last 3 years for every customer which can be extended to several years as needed. Finally you will be building retail data analytics dashboard with consumer and stores maps.\\\\n\\\\n[What you will learn]\\\\nYou will learn the complex usage of Pandas, matplotlib, Faker, numpy, datetime libraries in Python along with applied  data analytics into the Retail. We have used plotly mapping extensively so you will learn a lot on showing multi layers map using plotly and pandas dataset. \\\\n\\\\n[Future Extensions]\\\\nThere are several future possibilities with this project.  You can use Streamlit, Dask, H2O wave and other python based application to extend this project. You can build full stack applications using python, java quarkus as backend and React, next.js etc as front end with the dataset we generate in this project.  \\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac \\xe2\\x8f\\xb0 TUTORIAL TIME STAMPS \\xe2\\x8f\\xb0  \\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\xe2\\x96\\xac\\\\n- (00:00) Tutorial Starts\\\\n- (00:06) Content Introduction\\\\n- (05:26) Phase 1: Starts\\\\n- (07:54) Retail Data Management\\\\n- (11:08) Gnerating User Profile Master Data\\\\n- (12:26) Faker Tutorial\\\\n- (12:48) User Profile - Personal Info\\\\n- (15:17) User Profile - Job Info\\\\n- (15:45) User Profile - Credit card Info\\\\n- (16:30) User Profile - Income group Info\\\\n- (17:16) User Profile - Marital Status\\\\n- (19:44) User Profile - Vehicle Info\\\\n- (21:04) User Profile - Geo based Address\\\\n- (21:37) Accessing Walmart Locations\\\\n- (31:31) Show Walmart and user address in Map\\\\n- (35:38) Combining everything so far\\\\n- (47:25) Master Function to generate data\\\\n- (51:00) Saving master profile data\\\\n- (53:03) Phase 2: Product List Creation\\\\n- (53:44) Instacart Product Data\\\\n- (59:12) Phase 3: Master Store List Creation\\\\n- (01:03:21) Phase 4: Purchase History Creation\\\\n- (01:12:38) Important concept for Geo Proximity\\\\n- (01:22:08) Finalizing Data Creation\\\\n- (01:22:48) Phase 5: Data Viz and Retail analytics\\\\n- (01:23:22) Store and user proximity map\\\\n- (01:37:43) Phase 6: Retail/Consumer Analytics\\\\n- (01:39:47) Retail data analytics\\\\n- (02:11:24) Future Extensions\\\\n- (02:14:10) Recap\\\\n\\\\nFull datasets, source code, notebooks at GitHub:\\\\nhttps://github.com/prodramp/python-projects/tree/main/Walmart-SuperMarket\\\\n\\\\nPlease visit:\\\\n------------------\\\\n- Prodramp LLC | https://prodramp.com |  @prodramp\\\\n- https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodramp\\\\n\\\\nContent Creator: Avkash Chauhan (@avkashchauhan)\\\\n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/avkashchauhan\\\\n\\\\nTags:\\\\n#python #dataengineering #walmart #ml #ai #aicloud #h2oai #driverlessai #machinelearning #cloud #mlops #model #collaboration #deeplearning #modelserving #modeldeployment #keras #tensorflow #pytorch #datarobot #datahub #aiplatform #aicloud #modelperformance #modelfit #modeleffect #modelimpact #modelbias #modeldeployment #modelregistery #modelpipeline #neptuneai   #streamlit #pythonapps #deepchecks #modeltesting #codeartifact #dataartifact #onnx #aws #supervisord #kaggle #keplergl #mapbox   #lightgbm #xgboost #classification #regression #dataengineering  #pandas #keras #tensorflow #tensorboard  #prodramp #avkashchauhan\"",
