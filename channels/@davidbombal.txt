    "desc": "Cisco have released Cisco Modeling Labs - Personal (CML-P) today. In this video I show you how to get CML running on a Windows 10 computer and create Cisco topologies. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll cover all the steps in this video:\\\\n1) How to download CML\\\\n2) How to download and install VMware Player (free hypervisor software)\\\\n3) How to import CML and properly configure VMware Player settings\\\\n4) How to configure CML initial settings such as usernames and IP addresses\\\\n5) How to access the CML server using the CLI and Web UI\\\\n6) How to license the CML server\\\\n7) How to build a Cisco topology consisting of Cisco routers and switches\\\\n\\\\nThis is a full demonstration showing you how to get CML working on your computer.\\\\n\\\\nCisco CML-P (VIRL 2) is here: Learn how to download, install and configure Cisco CML-P (VIRL 2) using VMware Player and Windows 10. The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don\\'t have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use.\\\\n\\\\nThe new version of Cisco VIRL 2 is one of your best options for CCNA,  CCNP and CCIE Labs. VIRL 2 has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. VIRL 2 supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don\\'t have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don\\'t have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG. \\\\n\\\\nYou don\\'t have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your VIRL subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a VIRL subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for VIRL. \\\\n\\\\nVIRL2 is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don\\'t have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. VIRL 2 has everything you need to get started.\\\\n\\\\nDisadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs.\\\\n\\\\nIs VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don\\'t limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough.\\\\n\\\\nCisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action. \\\\n\\\\nMenu:\\\\nOverview: 0:00\\\\nDocumentation: 0:56\\\\nDownload CML-P: 1:12\\\\nDownload VMware Workstation Player: 5:38\\\\nInstall VMware Player: 6:13\\\\nImport CML-P into VMware Player: 8:05\\\\nStart CML-P: 11:23\\\\nCML Initial Setup Wizard: 11:48\\\\nLogin to CL: 15:04\\\\nLogin to Web UI: 15:25\\\\nLicense CML: 15:52\\\\nCreate and test Cisco topology: 16:54\\\\n\\\\nVideos mentioned:\\\\nVIRL 1 installation: https://youtu.be/Ie5GwqtUVc8\\\\n\\\\n======================\\\\nSpecial Offers:\\\\n======================\\\\nCisco Press: Up to 50% discount\\\\nSave every day on Cisco Press learning products!

    "desc": "Can CML support multivendor topologies? Can you use other vendor VMs with CML? These are often asked questions. In this video I\\'m going to show you how to run a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) in Cisco CML (VIRL 2). \\\\n\\\\nBe warned! There are a number of steps required to make this work, but it\\'s definitely possible. \\\\n\\\\nThis is Part 7 of my CML (VIRL 2) series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco VIRL 2 (CML-P). The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don\\'t have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use.\\\\n\\\\nThe new version of Cisco CML is one of your best options for CCNA,  CCNP and CCIE Labs. CML has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. CML supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don\\'t have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don\\'t have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG. \\\\n\\\\nYou don\\'t have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your CML subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a CML subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for CML. \\\\n\\\\nCML (VIRL2) is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don\\'t have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. CML (VIRL 2) has everything you need to get started.\\\\n\\\\nDisadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs.\\\\n\\\\nIs VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don\\'t limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough.\\\\n\\\\nCisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action. \\\\n\\\\nMenu:\\\\nOverview: 0:00\\\\nSteps: 4:17\\\\nDownload Windows VMs: 7:00\\\\nDownload and install QEMU: 8:32\\\\nUnzip Windows Zip file: 12:14\\\\nQEMU command to convert vmdk to qcow2: 13:17\\\\nIncrease storage space on CML (VIRL 2): 15:23\\\\nUse scp to copy qcow2 file to CML: 20:45\\\\nNode and image definitions: 24:37\\\\nAdd Windows VM to CML Topology: 28:57\\\\nStart Windows lab 30:15\\\\nPing Windows from outside: 32:38\\\\nRDP (Remote Desktop to Windows VM): 33:50\\\\n\\\\nPDF: https://bit.ly/cmlwindow10vm\\\\n\\\\nVideos:\\\\nStart here for CML information: https://youtu.be/sW5-jHLygFg\\\\n\\\\nCisco Modeling Labs\\\\nCML-P\\\\nCML-E\\\\nVIRL\\\\nVIRL 2\\\\nCML\\\\nCisco Modeling Labs - Personal\\\\nEVE-NG\\\\nGNS3\\\\nPacket Tracer\\\\nCCNA\\\\nCisco Devnet Associate\\\\n\\\\nCCNP Enterprise\\\\nCCNP Security\\\\nCCNP Data Center\\\\nCCNP Service Provider\\\\nCCNP Collaboration\\\\nCisco Certified Devnet Professional\\\\nCisco Certified Network Professional\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that links listed may be affiliate links and provide me with a small percentage/kickback should you use them to purchase any of the items listed or recommended.

All you need is your web browser (you will need to install Cisco AnyConnect VPN client to access the labs remotely).\\\\n\\\\nThis is Part 6 of my CML (VIRL 2) series showing you how to download, install and configure Cisco VIRL 2 (CML-P). The new version of Cisco VIRL allows you to create virtual Cisco networks using just your Web browser. You don\\'t have to use a thick client or any other software - everything is included and everything is easy to use.\\\\n\\\\nThe new version of Cisco VIRL 2 is one of your best options for CCNA,  CCNP and CCIE Labs. VIRL 2 has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. VIRL 2 supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images. You don\\'t have to use a thick client like you do with GNS3. You don\\'t have to follow a convoluted process to get Cisco images working like you do with EVE-NG. \\\\n\\\\nYou don\\'t have to try to find images as they are all included as part of your VIRL subscription and by simply mapping an ISO drive to your virtual machine you can immediately start using all Cisco IOS images in your topologies. Both EVE-NG and GNS3 require that you provide your own IOS images - typically they recommend that you buy a VIRL subscription anyway. That means that you are already paying for VIRL. \\\\n\\\\nVIRL2 is also an official Cisco product - that means that you don\\'t have to worry about any gray legal issues with regards to running Cisco IOS images on your laptop. This is an official Cisco product that is supported by Cisco. By paying your yearly subscription fee of $199, you can use Cisco IOS images such as IOSv, IOSvL2, ASAv, NX-OSv and others without any worries. VIRL 2 has everything you need to get started.\\\\n\\\\nDisadvantages include the requirement to license your installation. That however has been simplified dramatically from previous releases. There is also a 20 node limited in topologies. However, for most of us that is fine for a lot of labs.\\\\n\\\\nIs VIRL better than GNS3 or EVE-NG? In many ways it is. But, all platforms have advantages and disadvantages. If you are studying for your ccie, you many prefer gns3 or eve-ng as they don\\'t limit the number of devices in a topology like virl does. VIRL-PE limits you to 20 devices - so your topologies cannot be massive like they could with gns3 or eve ng. However, if you are studying for your ccna or ccnp, VIRL may be more than enough.\\\\n\\\\nCisco have made massive changes to their certification programs and it is fantastic to see the new version of VIRL in action. \\\\n\\\\nMenu:\\\\nOverview: 0:00\\\\nMore surprises: 2:10\\\\nDifferences between CML-E and CML-P: 3:04\\\\nLink to access CML lab: 4:39\\\\nHow to book a lab: 5:12\\\\nAnyConnect VPN Software: 7:40\\\\nAccess the Lab: 9:11\\\\nTroubleshooting: 10:15\\\\nLogin in to CML: 13:00\\\\nCreate and configure own lab: 14:00\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nVideos mentioned:\\\\nCML-P Part 1: https://youtu.be/sW5-jHLygFg\\\\nPrevious DevNet VIRL: https://youtu.be/TmGNtvh1eeY\\\\n\\\\nCisco Modeling Labs\\\\nCML-P\\\\nCML-E\\\\nVIRL\\\\nVIRL 2\\\\nCML\\\\nCisco Modeling Labs - Personal\\\\nEVE-NG\\\\nGNS3\\\\nPacket Tracer\\\\nCCNA\\\\nCisco Devnet Associate\\\\n\\\\nCCNP Enterprise\\\\nCCNP Security\\\\nCCNP Data Center\\\\nCCNP Service Provider\\\\nCCNP Collaboration\\\\nCisco Certified Devnet Professional\\\\nCisco Certified Network Professional\\\\n\\\\nPlease note that links listed may be affiliate links and provide me with a small percentage/kickback should you use them to purchase any of the items listed or recommended.

VIRL 2 has multiple advantages over other platforms such as GNS3 or EVE-NG. VIRL 2 supports an HTML5 web client and contains all the Cisco IOS images.

Kali Linux can be used to implement an ARP poisoning attack which can result in a man-in-the-middle attack to capture passwords. Stop ARP poisoning attacks by implement Dynamic ARP Inspection. \\\\n\\\\nIn a previous video I demonstrated how to use Ettercap and Kali Linux to capture usernames and passwords by poisoning the ARP caches of a Windows 10 computer and Cisco router. In this video I\\'ll show you how to stop this type of attack.\\\\n\\\\nARP spoofing attacks and ARP cache poisoning can occur because ARP allows a gratuitous reply from a host even if an ARP request was not received. After the attack, all traffic from the device under attack flows through the attacker\\'s computer and then to the router, switch, or host.\\\\n\\\\nAn ARP spoofing attack can target hosts, switches, and routers connected to your Layer 2 network by poisoning the ARP caches of systems connected to the subnet and by intercepting traffic intended for other hosts on the subnet. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s so easy to hack badly configured networks using Kali Linux!

Brave blocks adverts, forces HTTPS upgrades and saves you bandwidth with the use of privacy shields. What I really like about Brave is that it includes Tor. So, if you want anonymous browsing and a secure Internet connection giving you privacy, you don\\'t have to install the Tor browser, but you can get the features of Tor directly within Brave.\\\\n\\\\nPi-hole supports multiple linux operating systems including raspbian for raspberry pi.

Is wifi 6 better? I think so based on my tests. I am getting over 800 Mbps on a iPhone and over 900 Mbps with a PC. I think that is good performance! However, this is in a test environment - your results may vary depending on where you position the WiFi access point or router and what interference you encounter (thick walls, metal etc).

It\\'s important that you as a network professional know how to protect networks from hackers. Even the new Cisco CCNA 200-301 exam covers some of these hacking topics. Don\\'t just learn the theory of hacking, learn how to hack practically. \\\\n\\\\nIn this Ethical Hacking with Kali Linux playlist, I\\'m going to show you step by step how to hack and protect networks. This is white-hat hacking, not black-hat -  in other words this is about teaching you Ethical hacking to help you better secure your networks!\\\\n\\\\nIn this video I\\'ll show you how to poison the ARP cache of a Windows 10 computer and then implement a Man in the middle (MITM) attack so you can see all data sent between the Windows 10 computer and it\\'s default gateway.

In Discipline Equals Freedom, the #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Extreme Ownership describes how he lives that mantra: the mental and physical disciplines he imposes on himself in order to achieve freedom in all aspects of life. Many books offer advice on how to overcome obstacles and reach your goals\\xe2\\x80\\x95but that advice often misses the most critical ingredient: discipline. Without discipline, there will be no real progress. Discipline Equals Freedom covers it all, including strategies and tactics for conquering weakness, procrastination, and fear, and specific physical training presented in workouts for beginner, intermediate, and advanced athletes, and even the best sleep habits and food intake recommended to optimize performance.\\\\n\\\\nWithin these pages discover the keys to becoming stronger, smarter, faster, and healthier. There is only one way to achieve true freedom: The Way of Discipline. Read this book and find The Way.\"",

But, it depends! \\\\n\\\\nAdministrative distance (AD) or route preference is a number of arbitrary unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes. The value is used by vendor-specific routers to rank routes from most preferred (low administrative distance value) to least preferred (high administrative distance value). When multiple paths to the same destination are available in its routing table, the router uses the route with the lowest administrative distance. Router vendors typically design their routers to assign a default administrative distance to each kind of route that is used, however, this value can usually be adjusted manually by a network administrator.\\\\n\\\\n#CCNA #AdminDistance #Routing\"",

I only had 4 hours between the two jobs to sleep. \\\\n- Couldn\\'t afford regular meals so I was eating out of a snack machine most of the time. \\\\n-  My stress levels were through the roof since my car was always breaking down, didn\\'t have any savings or really a place to live to call my own. \\\\n- I was probably in a constant state of working through any illnesses I caught because I couldn\\'t afford to take a day off. Friends who saw me during this time said I was wrecked and I certainly felt like it. \\\\n\\\\nNow in 2018: \\\\n- Finished college and grad school\\\\n- Definitely have some certifications out of the way \\\\n- In a job that I love\\\\n- I don\\'t have 2 full time jobs with only 3-4 hours inb\\\\n- I\\'ve achieved a lot of great professional goals and I have a lot more on the horizon that I\\'m working on\\\\n- I eat much healthier now\\\\n- I work out \\\\n- My personal life is much better.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s to another 10 years of progress and health!\\\\n\\\\nSee here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6490492376430313472\\\\n\\\\nNote: Travel and conference access courtesy of Cisco.\"",

To disable the feature, deselect the check box.\\\\n\\\\nUse the --nested-hw-virt option of the VBoxManage modifyvm command to enable or disable nested virtualization.

When you create a new session, reference that stored credential rather than typing it out again.  Update all session credentials by updating the stored credential.\\\\n\\\\nSearch or Quick Connect:\\\\nDid you notice the field you use to search for a saved session can also be used to quick connect?  Try entering an IP and port, like 10.199.4.12:22 and pressing enter.\\\\n\\\\nColors:\\\\nColors can be used to remind you which sessions go to production gear, which data center your connected to, or anything else you like.  Set the color when creating a new session or editing an existing session.\\\\n\\\\nKey shortcuts:\\\\nKeep your hands on the keyboard because mice are slow!\\\\nCtrl + t: Open a new tab\\\\nCtrl + w: Close tab\\\\nAlt+F4: Exit Solar-PuTTY\\\\n\\\\nScripts - Automated login, bulk configuration:\\\\nScripts are executed immediately after login.  You can use scripts to automatically enter enable/privileged exec.  You can also create longer scripts to make configuration changes to a device and then run the script on several sessions.  Just like credentials, these are stored and can be referenced by any session.\\\\n\\\\nSession - Export and import:\\\\nWhether you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a classroom or in the office it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pain to share connection information verbally.  Instead, use the three dots in the top left of Solar-PuTTY to export your sessions and have your pal import them.  Less talk, more results.\\\\n\\\\nTags - Better than folders:\\\\nTags are a great way to organize your sessions without having to worry about hierarchy or overlap.  We like to use them for location (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDallas Datacenter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and roles (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorder Router\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), but you can use them for anything you like.  Create tags in Settings (Ctrl + s).  Apply tags to any sessions.  Tags are searchable!\\\\n\\\\nSession Logging - Know your work:\\\\nDreaming of a CCIE?  Review your logs after a lab and assess opportunities where you can improve in terms of accuracy, speed, order of operations; all important for the CCIE.  Bad outage caused by a config?  Prove exactly what you did or did not do.  Better yet, prove how you fixed it!  Session logging can be enabled when you create a new session or by editing an existing session.\"",

It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. A link-state protocol makes routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. The state of a link is a description of that interface and the relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the routers connected to that network, and so forth. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs).\\\\n\\\\nOSPF version 3, which is described in RFC 2740, supports IPv6.\\\\n\\\\nHow OSPFv3 Works\\\\nOSPFv3 is a routing protocol for IPv4 and IPv6. It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. Think of a link as being an interface on a networking device. A link-state protocol makes its routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. The state of a link is a description of that interface and its relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the devices connected to that network, and so on. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs).\\\\n\\\\nA device\\'s collection of LSA data is stored in a link-state database. The contents of the database, when subjected to the Dijkstra algorithm, result in the creation of the OSPF routing table. The difference between the database and the routing table is that the database contains a complete collection of raw data; the routing table contains a list of shortest paths to known destinations via specific device interface ports.\\\\n\\\\nOSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, supports IPv6 and IPv4 unicast AFs.\\\\n\\\\nComparison of OSPFv3 and OSPF Version 2\\\\nMuch of OSPF version 3 is the same as in OSPF version 2. OSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, expands on OSPF version 2 to provide support for IPv6 routing prefixes and the larger size of IPv6 addresses.\\\\n\\\\nIn OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process, and its associated configuration, to be created.\\\\n\\\\nIn OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.\\\\n\\\\nIn IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.\\\\n\\\\nOSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces.

It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. A link-state protocol makes routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. The state of a link is a description of that interface and the relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the routers connected to that network, and so forth. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs).\\\\n\\\\nOSPF version 3, which is described in RFC 2740, supports IPv6.\\\\n\\\\nHow OSPFv3 Works\\\\nOSPFv3 is a routing protocol for IPv4 and IPv6. It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. Think of a link as being an interface on a networking device. A link-state protocol makes its routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. The state of a link is a description of that interface and its relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the devices connected to that network, and so on. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs).\\\\n\\\\nA device\\'s collection of LSA data is stored in a link-state database. The contents of the database, when subjected to the Dijkstra algorithm, result in the creation of the OSPF routing table. The difference between the database and the routing table is that the database contains a complete collection of raw data; the routing table contains a list of shortest paths to known destinations via specific device interface ports.\\\\n\\\\nOSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, supports IPv6 and IPv4 unicast AFs.\\\\n\\\\nComparison of OSPFv3 and OSPF Version 2\\\\nMuch of OSPF version 3 is the same as in OSPF version 2. OSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, expands on OSPF version 2 to provide support for IPv6 routing prefixes and the larger size of IPv6 addresses.\\\\n\\\\nIn OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process, and its associated configuration, to be created.\\\\n\\\\nIn OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode.\\\\n\\\\nWhen using a nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID.\\\\n\\\\nIn IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link.\\\\n\\\\nOSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen. You cannot tell OSPF to use any particular interface.\"",

If you do not subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which is unrealistic.\\\\n\\\\nEach data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, that connects n networks/subnetworks has n distinct IP addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to subnet a network, extend the natural mask with some of the bits from the host ID portion of the address in order to create a subnetwork ID.\\\\n\\\\nAn IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot). For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.\\\\n\\\\nHere is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 20. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so that means I need to configure router 4 and the Internet router. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do router 4 first. \\\\ninterface serial0/1/0\\\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this interface  \\\\nIn the real world, you could use commands such as show cdp neighbors \\\\nto verify neighbor connectivity if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure how interfaces are connected and you want to verify interface connectivity. \\\\n\\\\nSo this is definitely the local interface connected to the Internet router.  \\\\nSo on that interface\\\\ninterface serial0/1/0 \\\\nip address 192.168.1.117\\\\nFirst IP address in subnet is 1 more than the subnet address and because this is a /30 the last IP address is simply the next IP address in that subnet. \\\\n\\\\nSo interface serial 0/2/0 \\\\nip address is 192.168 \\\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in this subnet\\\\nSo it would be 118, so 1.118 /30 mask\\\\nSo can we ping the other side?  Yes we can and we can see that an OSPF neighbor relationship has been established.  \\\\n\\\\nSo back on router 4, OSPF neighbor relationship is established. \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned a default route via the Internet router. \\\\nSo ip domain-lookup\\\\nip name-server is going to be Google, ping Cisco.com. We can ping Cisco.com.  \\\\nCan we ping Facebook.com?  Yes we can.  \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve configured the WAN links and updated them per the new subnets that we have.\\\\nThe next step is to configure this subnet. So we need to use this subnet for this local area network.  \\\\n\\\\nNow the way that you work out first host, last host broadcast, is once again, first host is simply the next IP address after the subnet. \\\\nSo binary, it would look like that, host portion is set to 0s except for the last bit which is set to 1, but in decimal it simply add one to the network portion.  \\\\nThe broadcast would be one less than the next subnet. \\\\n\\\\nSo the next subnet is 80, so the broadcast would be 79. And to work out the broadcast portion, you fill the host portion with binary 1s. And again, we can verify that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it right 79. \\\\nIt looks like this in binary. So 0100 followed by 4 1s. \\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correct. And then, the last host in the subnet is 1 less than the broadcast address, so 78. \\\\n\\\\nAnd if you want to work it out in binary, you set the host portion to binary 1s except for the last bit which is set to 0.  Host portion for subnet looks like that filled with 0s, broadcast is filled with 1s, first host is filled with 0s except for the last bit which is set to 1, last host has it filled with 1s except for the last bit which is set to 0.  \\\\nSo the last IP address and the subnet which we need to use on router 4 is 79, so 192.168.1.79\"",

Can you fix the network?\\\\n\\\\nVLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP) reduces administration in a switched network. When you configure a new VLAN on one VTP server, the VLAN is distributed through all switches in the domain. This reduces the need to configure the same VLAN everywhere. VTP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol that is available on most of the Cisco Catalyst series products.\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nVTP packets are sent in either Inter-Switch Link (ISL) frames or in IEEE 802.1Q (dot1q) frames. These packets are sent to the destination MAC address 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC with a logical link control (LLC) code of Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) (AAAA) and a type of 2003 (in the SNAP header).\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nSo in this lab, we need to configure VTP or VLAN Trunking Protocol so that VLANs can be added to switch 1 and switch 2 but not to switch 3. Switch 2 should not synchronize its VLAN database with other switches. So that means, that switch 2 needs to be configured as transparent switch.  \\\\n\\\\nIf you want to be able to add VLANs to a switch but not synchronize VLANs with other switches, the VTP mode needs to be transparent.  \\\\n\\\\nFirst thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is set the domain. \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to use a domain of CCNA. \\\\nSo vtp domain ccna \\\\nVTP mode will be transparent.  \\\\n\\\\nSo show vtp status\\\\nthe switch is configured with this domain. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configured as a transparent switch. \\\\nSwitch 1 needs to be configured as a VTP server because we need to be able to add VLANs to the switch and it needs to synchronize its VLANs to switch 3.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on switch 1\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give this name, \\\\nso switch 1\\\\nvtp domain is going to be ccna again\\\\nVtp  mode is going to be server\\\\nThat is the default, so we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to configure that. \\\\n\\\\nshow vtp status\\\\nWe can see that the domain is set to CCNA, the mode is server. \\\\nSo that looks good. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that we should configure switch 3 so that VLANs cannot be added to the switch. That means it needs to be configured as a VTP client.  \\\\n\\\\nSo host name will be switch 3\\\\nvtp  domain is ccna\\\\nvtp  mode is going to be client\\\\nshow vtp status\\\\nWe can see that the domain is CCNA, we can see that the mode is client. \\\\nSo that looks good.  \\\\n\\\\nNow, our VLANs actually being synchronized\\\\nso on switch 1\\\\nshow vlan brief\\\\nWe have VLANs 1, 1000 and 2,3,4 and 5,  in other words, the default VLANs in the VLAN database. \\\\n\\\\nconf t \\\\nvlan 2\\\\nWe should see that VLAN added, which it has been that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be added to switch 2. \\\\n\\\\nSo show vlan brief\\\\nSwitch 2 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have VLAN 2 in the VLAN database, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\"",

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that the switch is unable to perform trunk negotiation on gigabit 1/0/1 because of the VTP domain mismatch and we are seeing that message in multiple times. \\\\n\\\\nOn switch 1, we have an issue on this port and we already know kind of what the problem is, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a domain mismatch we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told.  \\\\n\\\\nOn switch 2, do we see something similar?  And the answer is yes we do.  \\\\nOn switch 2, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also told that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a domain mismatch. \\\\nSo on switch 2\\\\nshows vtp \\\\nand notice that message is constantly showing up. \\\\n\\\\nSo show vtp status \\\\non switch 2 shows us that the domain is set to Cisco.  \\\\n\\\\nWhat is the domain on switch 1? \\\\nNotice on switch 1, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still getting those messages. Scrolling up you can see the show VTP status command and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t if you saw that but the domain was set to CCNA and here it is again.  \\\\n\\\\nSo the VTP domain on switch 1 is CCNA but the VTP domain on switch 2 is Cisco. \\\\nSo if we want to replicate VLANs or synchronize VLANs between the switches, we need to make sure that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the same domain.  \\\\n\\\\nSo looking at both these switches again, switch 1 is in this domain. \\\\nSwitch 1 is configured as a VTP server, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. \\\\nSwitch 2 is configured in this domain, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also configured as a server. \\\\n\\\\nWhat we might to do is set the VTP mode to client. \\\\nSo notice I can set the VTP mode to client now. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to help us in this example because we still need to configure the domain name properly.  \\\\nNotice however on switch 1, the revision number is set to 0. If I do add a VLAN here, so VLAN 2, the revision number changes to 1. But we still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that on switch 2.  Configuration revision number is 0 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a domain mismatch. \\\\n\\\\nSo conf t \\\\nvtp domain and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to set it to CCNA. \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that the domain name has been changed. \\\\n\\\\nSo now, show vtp status\\\\nNotice the configuration revision number has increased to 1 and the domain name is set to CCNA. So in other words, this switch should have learned about VLAN 2 which it has. It would have learned that VLAN from switch 1. \\\\n\\\\nSo on switch 1, show vlan brief\\\\nAt the moment, we only have VLANs 1, 2 and the other default VLANs configured on the switch, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we see on switch 2, VLAN 1 and VLAN 2 are in the VLAN database. \\\\nBut what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do on switch 1 is create a third VLAN, VLAN 3. \\\\n\\\\nSo show vlan brief\\\\nnotice VLAN 3 is in the VLAN database.  \\\\nAnd back on switch 2\\\\nshow vlan brief\\\\nWe see the VLAN in the VLAN database.\\\\n\\\\nSo switch 2 is synchronizing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a VLAN database to switch 1. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. \\\\nWhat about switch 3? \\\\nOn switch 3 we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any messages apart from interfaces coming up. \\\\nshow vtp status\\\\nThe VTP domain is blank, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem and notice the VTP operating mode is transparent.  \\\\n\\\\nWe have two problems here. \\\\nWe need to set the domain correctly and we need to change the mode to client.  \\\\nshow vlan brief\\\\nNotice the switch hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learned about VLAN 2 and VLAN 3. \\\\nIf I set the mode to client, are there any changes? \\\\nSo show vtp status\\\\nmode is client, configuration revision number is 0, domain is still blank.  \\\\nNow be careful, in the real world, switches can learn the VTP domain and automatically join it. \\\\n\\\\nshow vtp status on switch 1\\\\nThe configuration revision number is 2. We should see that on switch 3 once the domain is configured. \\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s set the VTP domain to CCNA.\\\\n\\\\nshow vtp status \\\\nconfiguration revision number is still 0 even though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve manually configured the domain name. That means that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another problem..........\"",

If you do not subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which is unrealistic.\\\\n\\\\nEach data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, that connects n networks/subnetworks has n distinct IP addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to subnet a network, extend the natural mask with some of the bits from the host ID portion of the address in order to create a subnetwork ID.\\\\n\\\\nAn IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot). For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.\\\\n\\\\nHere is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 20. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis packet tracer lab is a continuation of a previous tracer lab.\\\\nIn the previous lab, you were asked to subnet 192.168.1.0 /24 and break it up into subnets for site 1 and site 2. And you were asked to configure subnets on those sites as well as on these serial links. \\\\n\\\\nIn this lab, you need to subnet the network again to extend and conserve IP addresses. \\\\nAn additional site has been added to the lab site 3. \\\\nWhat you need to do is take the subnet 192.168.1.64 /26 and subnet that to support this third site, as well as to reuse the subnet for the 3 serial connections.  \\\\n\\\\nSerial links only need /30 mask. \\\\nSo you need to subnet the last new subnet that you get from 192.168.1.64 /26 and use /30 mask so that you can allocate that subnet to the 3 serial links.  \\\\n\\\\nSo what you need to do once again, is break up 192.168.1.64 /26 to support as many subnets as possible with 8 hosts per subnet.  It allocate the first new subnet to site 3, so in other words on the local area network over here and then take the last new subnet that you get from 192.168.1.64 and subnet that with /30 masks and then allocate those subnets to the serial links.  You need to configure the routers appropriately, so this router needs to use the first IP address in the new subnet, this router the last one and the same is true for the other sites.  \\\\n\\\\nOn the local area network at site 3, router 4 should use the last IP address in the new subnet. The switch, the second last IP address and the subnet and the hosts should be allocated IP addresses from the 1st available IP address to the last available IP address.  You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to configure the IP addresses in the subnet manually. Previously, we used DHCP to allocate IP addresses to PCs, but in this subnet, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use static IP addresses.  \\\\n\\\\nNow once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve configured the network, verify that PCs can access Cisco.com and Facebook.com using their browsers.  Cisco.com and Facebook.com are websites on the Internet. You need to verify that your PCs - PC 6, 7 \\\\u0026 8 can access the Internet as well as choose a PC in site 1 and site 2 and make sure that they can also access Cisco.com and Facebook.com.  \\\\n\\\\nSo can you complete this lab?  \\\\nDownload the packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab yourself, otherwise watch the next video where I completed the lab.\"",

SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB) which describe the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.\\\\n\\\\nThree significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed.

But because this is a lab and we simply want to get used to using SNMP, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll configure SNMP with those 2 community strings.  \\\\n\\\\nSo show run \\\\nshows us those 2 SNMP community strings as configured on router 1. \\\\n\\\\nOn router 2, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do something very similar. \\\\nSo on router 2\\\\nsnmp-server community public read only\\\\nsnmp-server community private\\\\nis going to be read write\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got up two community strings configured on both routers. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s essentially all we need to do on the routers. \\\\nAnd now, on the PC, we should be able to use the MIB browser to interrogate the routers.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on the PC on the desktop, MIB browser, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put in the IP address of the first router. The IP addresses have been configured on these devices. \\\\n\\\\nSo show ip interface brief on router 1\\\\nshows us the IP address of router 1, so 10.1.1.1\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to click on advanced, read community is going to be public, write community is going to be private.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to use SNMP version 3 per these instructions. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to click OK and then hopefully I should be able to browse through the MIB tree until I find system, sysname. \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to get the host name of router 1 and router 2 as the first task.\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be using an SNMP get to do that, click go, should allow us to get the hostname of the router. And as you can see here, the router name is R1. If I do something similar with router 2, click go and notice the router name is R2. \\\\n\\\\nSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as simple as that to get the host name of the routers.  \\\\nNow we need to view the interfaces on R1. \\\\n\\\\nSo on interfaces and I need to do that in R1. You could do something similar on R1 if you want it to you.  Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a look at the interface index. There are interface numbers, description, notice there are the interfaces on the router. We can confirm that by using show ip interface brief on the router again. \\\\n\\\\nSo show ip interface brief\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got \\\\ngigabit 0/0  \\\\n0/1\\\\n0/2 loopback and VLAN 1 and there you go. \\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as simple as that to interrogate a router using SNMP and to get back information about the router.  \\\\n\\\\nSo what are the interface types? \\\\nSo I have type, click go. We can see copper gigabit, Ethernet, loopback and VLAN as the interface types. You could also look at other information such as maximum transmission unit, the speed of the interfaces, physical addresses, so the MAC addresses\\\\n\\\\nso on the router\\\\nshow interface gigabit 0/0\\\\nNotice the MAC address of gigabit 0/0 which is this interface over here. \\\\nSo SNMP allows a management station to get a lot of information about a device such as the status of interfaces. \\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administrative statuses.  \\\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operational statuses. \\\\nBecause we shut interfaces down, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re showing as both administratively down and operationally down. \\\\n\\\\nOnce again, the only interfaces enabled on the router are gigabit 0/0 and the loopback interfaces. Other interfaces are administratively down and we can see that through this interface.  \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a look at the routing table of router 1\\\\nso ip\\\\nip routing table\\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at the route destination. There are the routes in the routing table. We can confirm that again by looking at router 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CLI....\"",

Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.\\\\n\\\\nSNMP is widely used in network management for network monitoring. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems organized in a management information base (MIB) which describe the system status and configuration. These variables can then be remotely queried (and, in some circumstances, manipulated) by managing applications.\\\\n\\\\nThree significant versions of SNMP have been developed and deployed. SNMPv1 is the original version of the protocol. More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is an SNMP or Simple Network Management Protocol lab. \\\\nThis lab consists of a PC connected to a switch which in turn is connected to 2 routers.\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run SNMP on the routers. If you want to you can also enable SNMP on the switch and check information on the switch in a similar way to what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing on the routers.  \\\\n\\\\nThe tasks that you need to complete in this lab include enabling SNMP on both router 1 and router 2. \\\\nSo on router 1, which is 2911 and on router 2 is an ISR, configure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SNMP with community string public for read only and private for read write. Then use the MIB browser on the PC to view the hostname of router 1 and router 2.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on this PC, go to desktop, MIB browser, put in the IP address of the router that you want to check. You can get the IP address information by looking at the router. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nshows me that router 1 has this IP address configured on gigabit 0/0\\\\n\\\\nSo, on the MIB browser, put that IP address in, browse the MIB tree and then get the router name. Then view the interfaces on router 1 using the MIB browser. Look at interface types, view the routing table of the OSPF area a router ID of router 1, as well as the OSPF neighbors of router 1.  \\\\n\\\\nSo these are read SNMP commands that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be sending to the routers, but then you need to change the name of router 1 or R1 to Router1 using the MIB browser on the PC.  \\\\n\\\\nNow you can do more than what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve listed here. These tasks just give you some ideas of the things that you can do using SNMP between a PC and some routers. So if you want to try some other things, then do that. But here are some tasks to get you used to using SNMP. \\\\n\\\\nAs a bonus, which you can also do is run a simulation mode and then view the SNMP messages sent between the PC and the routers.  \\\\nSo actually have a look at the SNMP messages going back and forth between the PC and the routers.  \\\\nSo can you complete this lab?  \\\\nDownload the attached packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab yourself, otherwise watch the next video where I complete the lab.\"",

The protocol was designed by Cisco Systems as a proprietary protocol, available only on Cisco routers. Partial functionality of EIGRP was converted to an open standard in 2013 and was published with informational status as RFC 7868 in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nEIGRP is used on a router to share routes with other routers within the same autonomous system. Unlike other well known routing protocols, such as RIP, EIGRP only sends incremental updates, reducing the workload on the router and the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.\\\\n\\\\nEIGRP replaced the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) in 1993. One of the major reasons for this was the change to classless IPv4 addresses in the Internet Protocol, which IGRP could not support.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all routers contain a routing table that contains rules by which traffic is forwarded in a network.

If you do not subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which is unrealistic.\\\\n\\\\nEach data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, that connects n networks/subnetworks has n distinct IP addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to subnet a network, extend the natural mask with some of the bits from the host ID portion of the address in order to create a subnetwork ID.\\\\n\\\\nAn IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot). For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.\\\\n\\\\nHere is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 20. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nSo, on this subnet 192.168.1.128 /26, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to configure the router with the last IP address in the subnet. Now the next subnet is 192.  So the broadcast address for the subnet will be 191, which means that this router can be configured with 190. Have a look at to the previous videos in this series if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure how I worked that out.  \\\\n\\\\nSo IP address 192.168.1.192 is the next subnet, 191 is the broadcast, 190 is the last IP address in the subnet, subnet mask is that and we know that from our previous calculations.  The switch needs to use the second IP address in the subnet. The router is configured with 190. So the switch, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll change the name to switch 2, will simply use IP address 192.168.1.189, so 1 less than the router.  \\\\n\\\\nno shut the interface\\\\nSo ping 192.168.1.189, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our local IP address.  \\\\nCan we ping the router?  Yes, we can.  \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also configure a default gateway on the switch pointing to the router. Switch is configured. \\\\n\\\\nSo the switch once again is using 189, the DNS server should use 188, 1 less than the switch. So static IP address of the DHCP server is 192.168.188, subnet mask is 255.255.255.192, default gateway is the router 192.168.1.190.\\\\nAgain, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address of the router. DNS server will be Google.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on the server, can we ping the router? Type that right?  Yes, we can.  \\\\nCan we ping the switch?  Yes, we can.  \\\\nCan we ping the DNS server and not at the moment because we need to configure the serial interface of the router. \\\\n\\\\nBut now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configure the DHCP server. So DHCP, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll enable the DHCP servers, default gateway is going to be 192, so 192.168.1.190, DNS server is Google, IP addresses that will allocate are 192.168..1\\\\n\\\\nNow you need to be careful, the first host is one more than the subnet. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 129. Maximum number of hosts I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll allocate is 50 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save that configuration.  You could allocate more IP addresses in your pool or less if you wanted to. So for instance only allocate 10, just depends how many IP addresses in your subnet you want to have for static IP addresses, how many IP addresses you want for dynamic IP addresses.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on the PC\\\\nip config\\\\nIP address has been allocated. \\\\nping 192.168.1.190\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the router, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the switch, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the DNS server.  \\\\n\\\\nWhat about PC 5? \\\\nJust do one more here. \\\\nipconfig\\\\n IP address has been allocated. \\\\n\\\\nSo can we ping the router?  Yes, we can.  \\\\nWhat about switch?  Yes, we can.  \\\\nWhat about DNS server?  Yes, we can. \\\\n\\\\nWe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to ping 192.168.1.1 PC and the other subnet because we still need to configure this serial link.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configure the serial link. \\\\nThe IP address of this router on the serial interface is going to be 1 more than the subnet....\"",

I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll copy the previous example, but remember this is actually a different subnet now. The subnet address is /64. So, we will need to update these values in the last octet.\\\\n\\\\nSo to work out the first host you simply add one to the subnet portion. Subnet portion is 64. So 1 added to that is 65.\\\\n\\\\nThe next subnet is 128. So going back to our original example, this is the second subnet, this is the third subnet, 128. That means that the broadcast for the subnet is 127 because a 128 minus 1 equals 127. This is the next subnet minus 1 gives us our broadcast for the current subnet.\\\\nLast IP address in the subnet is 126, next one is 125, next one is 124.\\\\n\\\\nSo there is our subnet to broadcast for second and last host and third last host. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rejected the binary. You could do that if you wanted to. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simply using a quick method to work out the IP addresses.\\\\n\\\\nSo this router needs to be configured with the first IP address on the serial interface.\\\\nSo interface serial 0/1/0\\\\nno shut\\\\nip address 192.168.165 uses that subnet mask.\\\\n\\\\nSo again, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just 1 more than the broadcast address.\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address on the serial interface.\\\\nOn the Internet router, we need to use one less than the next subnet, so 127.\\\\n\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nOn the first serial interface\\\\ninterface serial 0/1/0\\\\nno shut\\\\nip address 192.168.1.126 with the subnet mask. 127 is the broadcast, one less than that gives us our last IP address.\\\\n\\\\nSo can we ping 192.168.165? Yes, we can. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\\\nWe have IP connectivity between this router and the Internet router and notice an OSPF neighbor relationship has come up. The routers were pre-configured with OSPF.\\\\nSo hopefully, this router can now ping the DNS server on the Internet and notice it can.\\\\n\\\\nOn PC 1, can it ping the DNS server? Yes, it can.\\\\nIf I trace to the DNS server, traffic is going to router 1, on the Ethernet interface, then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to the Internet router on the serial interface and then to the Internet. The reason it works this router has been pre-configured with OSPF but it also being pre-configured with network address translation. This lab is concentrating on subnetting, so I pre-configured the NAT and routing protocols so that you don\\'t have to worry about that.\\\\n\\\\nCan we get to Cisco.com? Yes, we can.\\\\nCan we get to Facebook.com? Yes, we can.\\\\nSo that works on PC 0.\\\\n\\\\nWhat about PC 2? Can we get to Cisco.com? Yes, we can.\\\\nCan we get to Facebook.com? Yes, we can.\\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hoping already at this point, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned a lot about IP addressing, subnetting, how to configure it and how to make it practical in a network.\\\\n\\\\nIn the next video, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just going to continue doing something very similar for the other subnets and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to speed it up by using tricks rather than binary.\"",

So notice host portion is all zeros. The first host has the host portion populated with binary zeros except for the last bit which is set to 1 in binary. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first host in the subnet. \\\\n\\\\nThe last host in the subnet has the host portion populated with binary ones except for the last bit which is set to binary 0. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you in a moment what that is, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easier to work out to the broadcast address first.  So the broadcast address equals that subnet and the host portion is populated with binary ones. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1 1 followed by 4 ones.\\\\n\\\\nNow you can work this out by saying 32 plus 16 plus 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1.But I find it easier to do the following: \\\\nIf this is set to 1 and everything else is set to zeros. So it looks like this, that equals 64, 1 less than that equals 63.  So if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asked for something like this, what is the broadcast address? Have a look at the next subnet and subtract 1 to get to the broadcast address of the previous subnet.  The next subnet is 192.168.1.64. The broadcast address of the previous subnet is that subnet minus 1. So in other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 63 and then this is 62. So for this subnet that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s network and first host, this is the last and broadcast address.  \\\\n\\\\nSecond last which we need for this switch is essentially 1 less than that. You can work out the binary but it may be easier just to subtract one from the decimal. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 61 and the third last is 1 less than that, which is 60.  So we now know the network, the first host, the broadcast, the last host, second last host and third last host. Easiest way to work this out is to work out to the network and then work out the next network.  One less than the next network gives you the broadcast address for the current subnet and then you can just subtract 1 from that to get to the last host, second last host and third last host.  First host is equal to the network portion plus 1, so there are our values; that means, we can now configure this router with the last IP address in the subnet.....\"",

So in other words, what we can do is change this last octet. The reason why we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t manipulate the first 3 octets is because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part of the network, 24 essentially means that we have 24 binary 1s.

So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 24 binary 1s which essentially equates to 255.255.255 0\\\\n\\\\n It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that you know how to convert decimal to binary.  This binary value equates to decimal 255, so the host portion of the address is once again that portion, this portion is the network portion. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t manipulate the network portion but the host portion consisting of 8 binary zeros can be manipulated.  \\\\n\\\\nNow when we subnet think of subnetting kind of like stealing bits. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to steal bits from the host portion. We need to work out how many bits are required for the number of subnets that we need.  In this example, we need 4 subnets. Now when it comes to subnetting, there are two formulas that you need to know: 2 to the power of N and 2 to the power of N minus 2. This formula is used when we asked for subnets, which is what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been asked in this question.  This formula we need to use when we asked for a certain number of hosts....\"",

If you do not subnet, you are only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which is unrealistic.\\\\n\\\\nEach data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnetworks, it allows you to create a network of interconnecting subnetworks. Each data link on this network would then have a unique network/subnetwork ID. Any device, or gateway, that connects n networks/subnetworks has n distinct IP addresses, one for each network / subnetwork that it interconnects.\\\\n\\\\nIn order to subnet a network, extend the natural mask with some of the bits from the host ID portion of the address in order to create a subnetwork ID.\\\\n\\\\nAn IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8 bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period (dot). For this reason, an IP address is said to be expressed in dotted decimal format (for example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from 0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.\\\\n\\\\nHere is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 20. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is a practical IPv4 subnetting lab. \\\\nNow this is a practical lab helping you test and verify your knowledge of IPv4  subnetting. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not simply going to talk about the theory of IPv4 subnetting. You need to subnet but in addition, configure the network and get it working. You need to configure IP addresses on routers, on switches and on DHCP servers. And then you need to configure the DHCP servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the correct subnet.  \\\\n\\\\nSo once again, this is a practical demonstration and lab of IPv4  subnetting.  \\\\nIn this packet tracer lab, we have a multiple sites, site 1 and site 2 connected via serial links to an Internet router. \\\\n\\\\nYou need to configure the network as follows. \\\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been allocated subnet 192.168.1.0 /24 and you need to subnet this network into 4 subnets as follows.  \\\\nSubnet 1 needs to be allocated to site 1\\\\nSubnet 2 to the serial link between router 1 and the Internet router\\\\nSubnet 3 to site 2 and subnet 4 to the link between router 2 and the Internet router. \\\\n\\\\nNow we are not going initially optimize the subnetting. \\\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only going to create 4 subnets and then split them across these 4 networks. \\\\n\\\\nIn the subsequent video will optimize the serial links to use a /30 mask and then make more subnets available for additional sites. But in this initial topology, you simply need to create 4 subnets.  You should configure the routers per the instructions in the diagram. In other words, this interface on router 1 should use the last IP address in the relevant subnet. This interface should use the first IP address in the subnet on the serial link.  The Internet router is going to use the last IP address in both subnets on the serial links and router 2 will once again use the last IP address in the subnet on the Ethernet interface and to the first IP address on the serial interface. \\\\n\\\\nYou need to configure these switches with the second last IP address and the subnet and the DHCP servers with the third or last IP address in the subnet.  \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, at site 1, the switch 1 should be configured with the second last IP address in the subnet and the DHCP server with the third last IP address. The same should be done for switch 2 in site 2, and the third last IP address should be configured on the DHCP server at site 2. \\\\n\\\\nYou also need to configure the DHCP servers to allocate IP addresses to the clients in the relevant subnets.\\\\nSo as an example, DHCP server 1 should allocate IP addresses PC 0, PC 1 \\\\u0026 PC 2 in the subnet allocated to this network....\"",

This attribute uses weight to select a best path. The weight is assigned locally to the router. The value only makes sense to the specific router. The value is not propagated or carried through any of the route updates. A weight can be a number from 0 to 65,535. Paths that the router originates have a weight of 32,768 by default, and other paths have a weight of 0.\\\\n\\\\nRoutes with a higher weight value have preference when multiple routes to the same destination exist.\\\\n\\\\nMED:\\\\nThe metric attribute also has the name MULTI_EXIT_DISCRIMINATOR, MED (BGP4), or INTER_AS (BGP3). The attribute is a hint to external neighbors about the path preference into an AS. The attribute provides a dynamic way to influence another AS in the way to reach a certain route when there are multiple entry points into that AS. A lower metric value is preferred more.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike local preference, metric is exchanged between ASs. A metric is carried into an AS but does not leave the AS. When an update enters the AS with a certain metric, that metric is used to make decisions inside the AS. When the same update passes on to a third AS, that metric returns to 0. The diagram in this section shows the set of metric. The metric default value is 0.\\\\n\\\\nUnless a router receives other directions, the router compares metrics for paths from neighbors in the same AS. In order for the router to compare metrics from neighbors that come from different ASs, you need to issue the special configuration command bgp always-compare-med on the router.\\\\n\\\\nNote: There are two BGP configuration commands that can influence the multi-exit discriminator (MED)-based path selection. The commands are the bgp deterministic-med command and the bgp always-compare-med command. An issue of the bgp deterministic-med command ensures the comparison of the MED variable at route choice when different peers advertise in the same AS. An issue of the bgp always-compare-med command ensures the comparison of the MED for paths from neighbors in different ASs. The bgp always-compare-med command is useful when multiple service providers or enterprises agree on a uniform policy for how to set MED. Refer to How the bgp deterministic-med Command Differs from the bgp always-compare-med Command to understand how these commands influence BGP path selection.\\\\n\\\\nRoute Filtering and Manipulation\\\\nRoute filtering is a method for selectively identifying routes that are advertised or received from neighbor routers.

These settings are global for an address family. For some routes this may not be appropriate. For example, static routes may need to be redistributed with a next hop of self, but connected routes and routes learned via Interior Border Gateway Protocol (IBGP) or Exterior Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) may continue to be redistributed with an unchanged next hop.\\\\n\\\\nThe BGP route map next hop self functionality modifies the existing route map infrastructure to configure a new ip next-hop self setting, which overrides the bgp next-hop unchanged and bgp next-hop unchanged allpaths settings.\\\\n\\\\nThe ip next-hop self setting is applicable only to VPNv4 and VPNv6 address families. Routes distributed by protocols other than BGP are not affected.\\\\n\\\\nYou configure a new bgp route-map priority setting to inform BGP that the route map will take priority over the settings for bgp next-hop unchanged and bgp next-hop unchanged allpath. The bgp route-map priority setting only impacts BGP.

Route filtering may be used to manipulate traffic flows, reduce memory utilization, or to improve security. For example, it is common for ISPs to deploy route filters on BGP peerings to customers. Ensuring that only the customer routes are allowed over the peering link prevents the customer from accidentally becoming a transit AS on the Internet.

The predecessor of RIP was the Gateway Information Protocol (GWINFO) which was developed by Xerox in the mid-1970s to route its experimental network. As part of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol suite GWINFO transformed into the XNS Routing Information Protocol. This XNS RIP in turn became the basis for early routing protocols, such as Novell\\'s IPX RIP, AppleTalk\\'s Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and the IP RIP. The 1982 Berkley Software Distribution of the UNIX operating system implemented RIP in the routed daemon. The 4.2BSD release proved popular and became the basis for subsequent UNIX versions, which implemented RIP in the routed or gated daemon. Ultimately RIP had been extensively deployed before the standard written by Charles Hedrick was passed as RIPv1 in 1988.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nSo, on switch 1\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nThe switch isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t configured with an IP address. \\\\nSo what I can do is say interface Vlan1 no shut\\\\n Now I could statically allocate an IP address to the switch or use DHCP. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll simply use DHCP here.  In the real world, you probably want to use static IP address rather than DHCP IP addresses. But you can see the switch has been allocated to this IP address.  \\\\n\\\\nshow ip route\\\\nno gateway of last resort is set. ICMP cache is empty, that means we need to type IP default gateway and specify the default gateway if I can spell that, as being the router. \\\\n\\\\nSo now, show ip route \\\\nshows us that the switch has a default gateway of the router. So this switch should be able to ping Google.com, which it can. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.  \\\\n\\\\nOn switch 2, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll configure the IP address statically. So host switch 2, at the moment\\\\nshow ip interface brief \\\\nshows us that no IP address is configured on the switch. \\\\nSo when we look at the routing table, nothing is displayed. \\\\n\\\\nSo interface vlan 1\\\\nip address 10.1 and in this case it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in subnet 10.1.3. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give it IP address 2 and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say IP default gateway 10.1.3.1, which is router 2. \\\\nSo it should be able to ping the DNS server if everything is set up right, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s working.

Now what you may want to do is create an exclusion range before you create your pool to exclude a certain number of addresses so that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have conflicts.  \\\\n\\\\nshow ip dhcp binding\\\\nshows us IP addresses allocated. These PCs have already been allocated IP addresses 2, 3and 4 because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t create the exclusion range first. So ipconfig shows us that this IP address has been allocated to the PC and hopefully it should be able to ping Cisco.com, which it can, and hopefully it should be able to ping Facebook.com, which it can.  \\\\n\\\\nSo these devices here have been allocated IP addresses through DHCP and are able to ping devices on the Internet, and as an example, should be able to surf to Facebook.com, which they can, and to Cisco.com, which they can.  \\\\n\\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC 2, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC 0, can it get to Cisco.com?

Routers only know about connected and local routes. \\\\n\\\\nSo router 2 as an example will not be able to ping the loopback of router 1 because this network is not in router 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s routing table.  \\\\nThis network is in the routing table of router 2 and this network is in the routing table of router 3. Now you need to be careful. These are Class A networks.  \\\\n\\\\nshow run\\\\nshows us that this IP address is configured on the loopback of router 2.\\\\n\\\\nshow run on router 3\\\\nshows us that this IP address is configured on the loopback of router 3, and on router 1, we have this loopback configured. \\\\n\\\\nRIP by default does automatic summarization when you go across a Classful boundary. This network will automatically be summarized when advertised across these serial interfaces between the routers. So we need to disable automatic summarization when routes are advertised by the routers.  The core router is the Internet router. \\\\n\\\\nshow ip route \\\\nshows us that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any RIP routes in the routing table. It does have a gateway of last resort. It does have a static route pointing to the Internet that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because the router was allocated an IP address through DHCP by the Internet service provider or in this example, by DHCP server.   \\\\n\\\\nSo this router has a DHCP configured on one interface. So it has a default route to the Internet but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about other routes internally. It only knows about connected and local routes.  \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configure RIP version 2 on the individual routers. \\\\nOn router 1\\\\nRouter rip\\\\nThe version of RIP that we want to use is version 2.\\\\n\\\\nI want to disable automatic summarization.

In the required tasks section, you need to configure a RIP version 2 to enable connectivity between sites and verify that the router can ping each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loopback interfaces. \\\\n\\\\nIn this topology, we have 3 sites: site 1, site 2 and site 3 which are connected via an Internet router, so router 1 at site 1 is connected via serial link to the Internet facing router. So is router 2 and so is router 3. \\\\n\\\\nEach router has physical interfaces configured as well as loopback interfaces. \\\\nSo as an example, on router 1, show ip interface brief \\\\nshows us that the router has this IP address configured on gigabit 0/0/0. \\\\nSo that should be gigabit  0/0/0. It has this IP address configured on the serial interface and this IP address configured on the loopback interface.  \\\\n\\\\nYou need to make sure that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IP connectivity between the various devices in the network. You firstly need to ensure that the routers can ping each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loopbacks.  \\\\n\\\\nAt the moment, router 1 only displays connected and local routes in the routing table. \\\\nOn router 2, as an example, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the loopback of router 1 in the routing table. \\\\nSo if router 2 tries to ping router 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loopback interface, the pings are going to fail because the router doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to forward the traffic. You need to enable RIP on the routers and ensure that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IP connectivity between the loopbacks in the first part of this lab.  \\\\n\\\\nNow there are additional bonus tasks. \\\\nOnce you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve completed the required tasks, advertise default route on the Internet router to other routers via RIP. So within the RIP process on the Internet router, advertise a default route so that these routers can access devices on the Internet.  \\\\n\\\\nCreate DHCP pools on the routers, so on router 1, router 2 and router 3 to allocate IP addresses to PCs in the relevant subnets. Create a default route on the switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example on switch 1, this switch currently has no routes in the routing table, no default gateway is configured. ...\"",

How do you turn off auto-summary of routes? Does it matter?\\\\n\\\\nThe Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support.\\\\n\\\\nRIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.\\\\n\\\\nIn RIPv1 router broadcast updates with their routing table every 30 seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times.\\\\n\\\\nIn most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters unlike other protocols.\\\\n\\\\nRIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved port number 520\\\\n\\\\nBased on the Bellman\\xe2\\x80\\x93Ford algorithm and the Ford\\xe2\\x80\\x93Fulkerson algorithm distant-vector routing protocols started to be implemented from 1969 onwards in data networks such as the ARPANET and CYCLADES. The predecessor of RIP was the Gateway Information Protocol (GWINFO) which was developed by Xerox in the mid-1970s to route its experimental network. As part of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol suite GWINFO transformed into the XNS Routing Information Protocol. This XNS RIP in turn became the basis for early routing protocols, such as Novell\\'s IPX RIP, AppleTalk\\'s Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP), and the IP RIP. The 1982 Berkley Software Distribution of the UNIX operating system implemented RIP in the routed daemon. The 4.2BSD release proved popular and became the basis for subsequent UNIX versions, which implemented RIP in the routed or gated daemon. Ultimately RIP had been extensively deployed before the standard written by Charles Hedrick was passed as RIPv1 in 1988.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nBest practice is to disable automatic summarization.  \\\\nSo on router 3 at the moment, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have automatic summarization disabled. It is disabled on Router 2 and router 1. We disabled automatic summarization here on Router 2 and here on router 1.\\\\n\\\\nSo on router 3\\\\nrouter rip no auto-summary\\\\nNow it may take RIP a while to converge. So do force things I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simply going to turn off packet tracer and turn it on again. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll close packet tracer here and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start it up again. I found that with packet tracer sometimes when you make changes like ths, the best way to ensure that things are working properly, is to simply restart packet tracer.  \\\\n\\\\nOkay, so packet tracer has booted up again. \\\\nshow ip route\\\\nthis router has now learned about this network. Notice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a /24 network, not a /16. \\\\n\\\\nSo show ip rip database\\\\nwe see this network rather than a /16 in the RIP database.  Router 3 is not automatically summarizing this route. \\\\n\\\\nSo the network will function as it was before but is more reliable because we are not automatically summarizing routes. You need to be careful with automatic summarization. Best practice is to generally turn off automatic summarization in routing protocols such as RIP and EIGRP. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want automatic summarization in a network because as an example, if you had a 172.16 network here, you would have problems, so as an example, if I created a loopback on Router 1 and configured this IP address on the loopback and then advertised that network into RIP. \\\\n\\\\nshow run\\\\nshows us that that that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been changed to this. But because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve disabled automatic summarization, router 2 knows where both 172.16.1.0 is and 172.16.2.0.\\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, router 2 knows that to get to the subnet needs to send the traffic out of this interface. But to get to this subnet, it needs to send here the traffic out of this interface gigabit 0/0/0. That only works because automatic summarization has been disabled. So traffic is sent in the correct direction. Notice to get to 172.16.2.1, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going left and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s send the traffic to 1.2 which is the DNS server. Traffic is going to router 3 and then to the DNS server. So that works correctly....\"",

Static routes use less bandwidth than dynamic routes. No CPU cycles are used to calculate and analyze routing updates.\\\\n\\\\nYou can supplement dynamic routes with static routes where appropriate. You can redistribute static routes into dynamic routing algorithms but you cannot redistribute routing information calculated by dynamic routing algorithms into the static routing table.\\\\n\\\\nYou should use static routes in environments where network traffic is predictable and where the network design is simple. You should not use static routes in large, constantly changing networks because static routes cannot react to network changes. Most networks use dynamic routes to communicate between routers but might have one or two static routes configured for special cases. Static routes are also useful for specifying a gateway of last resort (a default router to which all unroutable packets are sent).\\\\n\\\\nAdministrative Distance\\\\nAn administrative distance is the metric used by routers to choose the best path when there are two or more routes to the same destination from two different routing protocols. An administrative distance guides the selection of one routing protocol (or static route) over another, when more than one protocol adds the same route to the unicast routing table. Each routing protocol is prioritized in order of most to least reliable using an administrative distance value.\\\\n\\\\nStatic routes have a default administrative distance of 1. A router prefers a static route to a dynamic route because the router considers a route with a low number to be the shortest. If you want a dynamic route to override a static route, you can specify an administrative distance for the static route. For example, if you have two dynamic routes with an administrative distance of 120, you would specify an administrative distance that is greater than 120 for the static route if you want the dynamic route to override the static route.\\\\n\\\\nDirectly Connected Static Routes\\\\nYou must specify only the output interface (the interface on which all packets are sent to the destination network) in a directly connected static route. The router assumes the destination is directly attached to the output interface and the packet destination is used as the next-hop address. The next hop can be an interface, only for point-to-point interfaces. For broadcast interfaces, the next hop must be an IPv4/IPv6 address.\\\\n\\\\nFully Specified Static Routes\\\\nYou must specify either the output interface (the interface on which all packets are sent to the destination network) or the next-hop address in a fully specified static route. You can use a fully specified static route when the output interface is a multi-access interface and you need to identify the next-hop address. The next-hop address must be directly attached to the specified output interface.\\\\n\\\\nFloating Static Routes\\\\nA floating static route is a static route that the router uses to back up a dynamic route. You must configure a floating static route with a higher administrative distance than the dynamic route that it backs up. In this instance, the router prefers a dynamic route to a floating static route. You can use a floating static route as a replacement if the dynamic route is lost.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCommands:\\\\n1. configure terminal\\\\n2. ip route { ip-prefix | ip-addr/ip-mask } {[ next-hop | nh-prefix ] | [ interface next-hop | nh-prefix ]} [ name nexthop-name] [ tag tag-value] [ pref ]\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so on router 3, this network and this network are not directly connected. \\\\nThis network and this network are directly connected. \\\\n\\\\nSo ip route destination network is 192.168.1.0 subnet mask is this or destination prefix mask.

Static routes use less bandwidth than dynamic routes. No CPU cycles are used to calculate and analyze routing updates.\\\\n\\\\nYou can supplement dynamic routes with static routes where appropriate. You can redistribute static routes into dynamic routing algorithms but you cannot redistribute routing information calculated by dynamic routing algorithms into the static routing table.\\\\n\\\\nYou should use static routes in environments where network traffic is predictable and where the network design is simple. You should not use static routes in large, constantly changing networks because static routes cannot react to network changes. Most networks use dynamic routes to communicate between routers but might have one or two static routes configured for special cases. Static routes are also useful for specifying a gateway of last resort (a default router to which all unroutable packets are sent).\\\\n\\\\nAdministrative Distance\\\\nAn administrative distance is the metric used by routers to choose the best path when there are two or more routes to the same destination from two different routing protocols. An administrative distance guides the selection of one routing protocol (or static route) over another, when more than one protocol adds the same route to the unicast routing table. Each routing protocol is prioritized in order of most to least reliable using an administrative distance value.\\\\n\\\\nStatic routes have a default administrative distance of 1. A router prefers a static route to a dynamic route because the router considers a route with a low number to be the shortest. If you want a dynamic route to override a static route, you can specify an administrative distance for the static route. For example, if you have two dynamic routes with an administrative distance of 120, you would specify an administrative distance that is greater than 120 for the static route if you want the dynamic route to override the static route.\\\\n\\\\nDirectly Connected Static Routes\\\\nYou must specify only the output interface (the interface on which all packets are sent to the destination network) in a directly connected static route. The router assumes the destination is directly attached to the output interface and the packet destination is used as the next-hop address. The next hop can be an interface, only for point-to-point interfaces. For broadcast interfaces, the next hop must be an IPv4/IPv6 address.\\\\n\\\\nFully Specified Static Routes\\\\nYou must specify either the output interface (the interface on which all packets are sent to the destination network) or the next-hop address in a fully specified static route. You can use a fully specified static route when the output interface is a multi-access interface and you need to identify the next-hop address. The next-hop address must be directly attached to the specified output interface.\\\\n\\\\nFloating Static Routes\\\\nA floating static route is a static route that the router uses to back up a dynamic route. You must configure a floating static route with a higher administrative distance than the dynamic route that it backs up. In this instance, the router prefers a dynamic route to a floating static route. You can use a floating static route as a replacement if the dynamic route is lost.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCommands:\\\\n1. configure terminal\\\\n2. ip route { ip-prefix | ip-addr/ip-mask } {[ next-hop | nh-prefix ] | [ interface next-hop | nh-prefix ]} [ name nexthop-name] [ tag tag-value] [ pref ]\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\nIn this packet tracer lab, you need to configure static routes to enable IP connectivity between PCs on the left and servers on the right.  \\\\nYou need to configure static routes using next hop IP addresses and do that without using default routes. \\\\nSo in other words, configure static routes using the correct subnet masks in this topology.  \\\\nThe devices in this network have passwords configured of cisco. So use that if prompted for a password. \\\\n\\\\nFor verification, you need to ensure that PC 1 \\\\u0026 PC 2 on the left can browse to Cisco.com. \\\\nDo that using the DNS name Cisco.com.

The RADIUS specification is described in RFC 2865 leavingcisco.com, which obsoletes RFC 2138 leavingcisco.com. Cisco is committed to supporting both protocols with the best of class offerings. It is not the intention of Cisco to compete with RADIUS or influence users to use TACACS+. You should choose the solution that best meets your needs. This document discusses the differences between TACACS+ and RADIUS, so that you can make an informed choice.\\\\n\\\\nCisco has supported the RADIUS protocol since Cisco IOS\\xc2\\xae Software Release 11.1 in February 1996. Cisco continues to enhance the RADIUS Client with new features and capabilities, supporting RADIUS as a standard.\\\\n\\\\nCisco seriously evaluated RADIUS as a security protocol before it developed TACACS+. Many features were included in the TACACS+ protocol to meet the needs of the growing security market. The protocol was designed to scale as networks grow, and to adapt to new security technology as the market matures. The underlying architecture of the TACACS+ protocol complements the independent authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRADIUS uses UDP while TACACS+ uses TCP. TCP offers several advantages over UDP. TCP offers a connection-oriented transport, while UDP offers best-effort delivery. RADIUS requires additional programmable variables such as re-transmit attempts and time-outs to compensate for best-effort transport, but it lacks the level of built-in support that a TCP transport offers:\\\\n\\\\nTCP usage provides a separate acknowledgment that a request has been received, within (approximately) a network round-trip time (RTT), regardless of how loaded and slow the backend authentication mechanism (a TCP acknowledgment) might be.\\\\n\\\\nTCP provides immediate indication of a crashed, or not running, server by a reset (RST). You can determine when a server crashes and returns to service if you use long-lived TCP connections. UDP cannot tell the difference between a server that is down, a slow server, and a non-existent server.\\\\n\\\\nUsing TCP keepalives, server crashes can be detected out-of-band with actual requests. Connections to multiple servers can be maintained simultaneously, and you only need to send messages to the ones that are known to be up and running.\\\\n\\\\nTCP is more scalable and adapts to growing, as well as congested, networks.\"",

It allows separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Each message is labeled with a facility code, indicating the software type generating the message, and assigned a severity label.\\\\n\\\\nComputer system designers may use syslog for system management and security auditing as well as general informational, analysis, and debugging messages. A wide variety of devices, such as printers, routers, and message receivers across many platforms use the syslog standard. This permits the consolidation of logging data from different types of systems in a central repository. Implementations of syslog exist for many operating systems.\\\\n\\\\nNTP:\\\\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.\\\\n\\\\nNTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo\\'s algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.\\\\n\\\\nThe protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.[4][5] They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.\\\\n\\\\nThe current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is a proposed standard as documented in RFC 5905. It is backward compatible with version 3, specified in RFC 1305\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThe first thing I need to do is configure the NTP server. \\\\nSo on the NTP server,  go to NTP and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll enable the NTP service. \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going enable authentication at this point. I can then specify the date and time.  \\\\nThis is okay for this lab.

So the time is wrong on both these devices. \\\\nBefore we configure NTP, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s send timestamp messages to the syslog server.  \\\\n\\\\nSo at the moment, the syslog server is not showing timestamps on syslog messages.\\\\nSo on the router, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to type \\\\nservice timestamps log messages date and time and milliseconds\\\\n\\\\nNotice the difference now when I type end\\\\nwe can see the date and time on the syslog message. \\\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wrong date and time. So that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really help us with troubleshooting. We want to know when something took place.  \\\\n\\\\nSo we want date and time as well as milliseconds. \\\\nBut again, the switch as showing the wrong date and time. \\\\nSo we need to fix that, so, on the router\\\\nntp server\\\\nWe need to specify the IP address of the NTP server; NTP server has this IP address 10.1.1.201\\\\n\\\\nSo specify IP address of NTP server. When I type end now and press Enter. Notice the correct date and time is displayed on the syslog message.  \\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the 12th of April 2018, the time is 4:42 am. \\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. \\\\n\\\\nConfigure the switch, so ntp server 10.1.1.201 type end\\\\nNotice the correct date and time is displayed.

It allows separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Each message is labeled with a facility code, indicating the software type generating the message, and assigned a severity label.\\\\n\\\\nComputer system designers may use syslog for system management and security auditing as well as general informational, analysis, and debugging messages. A wide variety of devices, such as printers, routers, and message receivers across many platforms use the syslog standard. This permits the consolidation of logging data from different types of systems in a central repository. Implementations of syslog exist for many operating systems.\\\\n\\\\nNTP:\\\\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.\\\\n\\\\nNTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the intersection algorithm, a modified version of Marzullo\\'s algorithm, to select accurate time servers and is designed to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.\\\\n\\\\nThe protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 123.[4][5] They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.\\\\n\\\\nThe current protocol is version 4 (NTPv4), which is a proposed standard as documented in RFC 5905. It is backward compatible with version 3, specified in RFC 1305\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nIn this lab, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to configure both syslog and NTP. \\\\nThe first thing we need to do is configure the syslog server. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll click on the syslog server, go to services, click syslog and enable the syslog server.  \\\\nThe IP address of the syslog server is 10.1.1.200\\\\nYou could also see that by using the ipconfig command in command prompt on the syslog server.  \\\\n\\\\nWe then need to configure both router 1 and switch 1 to log messages to the syslog server.

So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sending a broadcast from itself looking for the MAC address of PC 4. \\\\n\\\\nSo the same process will apply here. \\\\nPacket is flooded but the ARP packet is dropped up by PC 1 \\\\u0026 PC 2, only PC 4 will reply to the ARP packet and now ICMP messages are sent directly between those two devices.  \\\\n\\\\nMAC address table at this point only contains PC3 and PC4 because I previously cleared the MAC address table.

But notice here, PC 2 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the MAC address of PC 4. So it has to send an ARP into the network first, and I should have done that with simulation mode.

To simulate that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to power cycle the devices in packet tracer and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll connect it to the console of the switch.  \\\\n\\\\nSo essentially, this switch doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about the MAC addresses of the PCs in the topology when the switch first boots up. \\\\n\\\\nso show mac address-table\\\\nNotice the MAC address table is empty. The switch doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the MAC addresses of these 4 PCs.  The only way the switch is going to learn the MAC addresses of these devices is if they send traffic into the network.  \\\\n\\\\nNow in the real world, operating systems such as Windows, broadcast packets when they boot up. So switches will learn the MAC addresses of Windows devices when they first start up.  \\\\n\\\\nIn this example however, the packet tracer PCs don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t send any traffic even though they are configured with IP addresses and are configured with MAC addresses. \\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is go to simulation mode in packet tracer and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what happens when PC 1 pings PC 2. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address of PC 2. We can verify that by opening up a terminal Window or CMD prompt in Windows and looking at the configuration.\\\\n\\\\nipconfig /all \\\\nshows us both the MAC address and IP address of this PC.\\\\nSo when I press enter, notice two packets are generated. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got an ICMP packet as well as an ARP packet.  PC 1 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the MAC address of PC 2, so it sends out a broadcast. In other words it sends out an ARP message requesting the MAC address of PC 2. Source of this packet is PC1. Notice the MAC address and the frame is this, destination MAC address is a broadcast.  \\\\n\\\\nSo when that frame hits the switch, the switch is going to flood the frame. At this point, the switch knows the MAC address of PC 1, broadcasts are flooded by layer 2 switches but at least the switches learned the MAC address of PC 1.  PC 4 and Pc 3 will drop the ARP request because the ARP request is a broadcast looking for the MAC address of this PC. PC 4 as an example, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t configured with an IP address....\"",

It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It supports IPv6 and SSL.\\\\n\\\\nvsftpd supports explicit (since 2.0.0) and implicit (since 2.1.0) FTPS.\\\\n\\\\nvsftpd is the default FTP server in the Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, NimbleX, Slackware and RHEL Linux distributions.\\\\n\\\\nNginx ( /\\xcb\\x8c\\xc9\\x9bnd\\xca\\x92\\xc9\\xaan\\xcb\\x88\\xc9\\x9bks/ EN-jin-EKS) (stylized as NGINX, NGi\\xd0\\x98X or nginx) is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004. A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support.\\\\n\\\\nNginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of a BSD-like license. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer.\\\\n\\\\ntftpd: TCP/IP command. IPv4 Trivial File Transfer Protocol server. in.tftpd is normally started by inetd and operates at the port indicated in the tftp Internet service description in /etc/services. Only publicly readable files may be accessed. By default, only files that already exist and are publicly writable can be written. In addition, if any directories are specified, access is restricted to files in those directories. The version of tftp described here is tftp-hpa.\\\\n\\\\nRSYSLOG is the rocket-fast system for log processing.\\\\n\\\\nIt offers high-performance, great security features and a modular design.

    "desc": "Fantastic New Docker appliance available on GNS3: Networkers Toolkit\\\\n\\\\nThis Docker appliance  contains server side software for secondary management of network devices: \\\\n- www (nginx)\\\\n- ftp (vsftpd)\\\\n- tftp (tftpd)\\\\n- syslog (rsyslog)\\\\n- dhcp (isc-dhcpd)\\\\n- snmp server (snmpd + snmptrapd)\\\\n\\\\nGet https://gns3.com/marketplace/appliance/networkers-toolkit\\\\n\\\\nThank you to Andras Dosztal @adosztal for this great appliance!\\\\n\\\\nvsftpd, (or very secure FTP daemon),[1] is an FTP server for Unix-like systems, including Linux. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It supports IPv6 and SSL.\\\\n\\\\nvsftpd supports explicit (since 2.0.0) and implicit (since 2.1.0) FTPS.\\\\n\\\\nvsftpd is the default FTP server in the Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, NimbleX, Slackware and RHEL Linux distributions.\\\\n\\\\nNginx ( /\\xcb\\x8c\\xc9\\x9bnd\\xca\\x92\\xc9\\xaan\\xcb\\x88\\xc9\\x9bks/ EN-jin-EKS) (stylized as NGINX, NGi\\xd0\\x98X or nginx) is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache. The software was created by Igor Sysoev and first publicly released in 2004. A company of the same name was founded in 2011 to provide support.\\\\n\\\\nNginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of a BSD-like license. A large fraction of web servers use NGINX, often as a load balancer.\\\\n\\\\ntftpd: TCP/IP command. IPv4 Trivial File Transfer Protocol server. in.tftpd is normally started by inetd and operates at the port indicated in the tftp Internet service description in /etc/services. Only publicly readable files may be accessed. By default, only files that already exist and are publicly writable can be written. In addition, if any directories are specified, access is restricted to files in those directories. The version of tftp described here is tftp-hpa.\\\\n\\\\nRSYSLOG is the rocket-fast system for log processing.\\\\n\\\\nIt offers high-performance, great security features and a modular design. While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a kind of swiss army knife of logging, being able to accept inputs from a wide variety of sources, transform them, and output to the results to diverse destinations.\\\\n\\\\nAll IP devices need addresses, and ISC DHCP is the classic way to provide them. ISC DHCP is open source software that implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for connection to an IP network. It offers a complete solution for implementing DHCP servers, relay agents, and clients for small local networks to large enterprises. ISC DHCP solution supports both IPv4 and IPv6, and is suitable for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications. DHCP is available for free download under the terms of the ISC License, a BSD style license. (nb ISC DHCP will move to the MPL 2.0 license beginning with ISC DHCP 4.4.0)\\\\n\\\\nISC is developing a new DHCP server, Kea, which we intend to eventually replace ISC DHCP in most server implementations. We recommend that new implementers considering using Kea, and implement ISC DHCP only if Kea does not meet their needs. The Kea distribution does not currently include either a client or a relay.\\\\n\\\\nsnmptrapd is an SNMP application that receives and logs SNMP TRAP and INFORM messages.\\\\nNote: the default is to listen on UDP port 162 on all IPv4 interfaces. Since 162 is a privileged port, snmptrapd must typically be run as root.\"",

A lot of them are available within a few seconds or instantly. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem when we have technology such as Spanning Tree that take 30 seconds to converge and forward traffic on a network.  \\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is power cycle the devices and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put the lab into simulation mode. \\\\nNotice the switch has now booted up. Interfaces are showing orange. So what happens now is, if the PC sends a renew message, that DHCP message is going to be sent to the switch and then it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to drop until the ports go to green.  \\\\n\\\\nSo once the ports go to green, the DHCP request message can be forwarded but previously, that message from PC 1 was dropped because the ports were transitioning from listening to learning to forwarding. So during that period of time, DHCP messages will be dropped by the switch.  \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configure Spanning Tree PortFast on the switch. \\\\nOn which ports do I need to configure it? \\\\nI need to configure it on both the client ports and this server port. We essentially want these 3 ports in this topology to transition to the forwarding state immediately. \\\\n\\\\nOkay, so here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the switch. What I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is firstly give the switch a name and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to say interface range gigabit 1/0/1 to 3. Those are the three ports in our network that have devices connected to them. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to say spanning-tree and in this case, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to select portfast. \\\\nSo portfast enter\\\\nNotice we receive a warning message.  PortFast has been configured on this port. You can introduce loops if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not careful, so use with caution. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay for this example.  \\\\n\\\\nSo show run\\\\nnotice we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve enabled PortFast on these 3 ports. \\\\nSo what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do is save the switch configuration and what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do now is power cycle the devices and what we should see is that as soon as the switch boots up, the ports go to forwarding which they have now, and my PC can receive an IP address immediately.  \\\\n\\\\nSo again, if I do ipconfig /renew\\\\nthe PC receives an IP address immediately. The switch transitioned immediately to the forwarding state on those three ports. So Spanning Tree immediately transitioned to the forwarding state on those ports. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do that again, just to prove the point. \\\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the switch, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s busy booting up, and what you should notice is as soon as it boots up, that the ports go green.  \\\\nIn packet tracer, there you go. \\\\nshow spanning-tree \\\\nnotice the ports are immediately forwarding and a PC such as PC 1 immediately receives an IP address because the DHCP messages can be sent to the server immediately.  \\\\n\\\\nSo there you go. \\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an example of Spanning Tree PortFast.  \\\\nSo what have you learned? \\\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that Spanning Tree PortFast, transitions a port directly to the forwarding state. Instead of a transitioning from listening to learning to forwarding, with Spanning Tree PortFast ports configured as Spanning Tree PortFast ports immediately transition to forwarding, which means that PCs can get IP addresses from DHCP servers. Users can log in into services such as domain controllers without any delay and the network works more efficiently. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that you understand what Spanning Tree PortFast does for the CCNA exam.\"",

And they say that PortFast causes a switch or trunk port to enter the Spanning Tree forwarding state immediately by passing the listening and learning states.  \\\\n\\\\nYou can configure Spanning Tree PortFast on switch or trunk ports that are connected to a single workstation, switch or server to allow those devices to connect it to the network immediately, instead of waiting for the port to transition from the listening to learning to the forwarding state. \\\\n\\\\nBut you need to careful with Spanning Tree PortFast.  \\\\nIf you enable Spanning Tree PortFast on a port that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s connected to another layer 2  device such as a switch, you may create network loops.  So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see the problem practically in this network. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to power cycle the devices in the topology and then on PC 1, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to open up a command prompt and use the command ipconfig\\\\nNotice these ports are orange on the switch. \\\\nSo if I use the command ipconfig /renew\\\\nthe PC is not going to get an IP address because these ports are currently blocked by Spanning Tree.  \\\\n\\\\nOn the switch show spanning- tree\\\\nNotice the ports are currently in the learning state. Spanning Tree is just gone green, but notice in the output of my switch, I see that they are currently in the learning state. So this command shows us the state of ports. \\\\n\\\\nDo that again, we can see that the ports are now forwarding. But while the switch was transitioning from blocking to listening to learning to forwarding, the PC wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t able to get an IP address.  So would end up using an address in this range. Later on, the PC would get an IP address if it continues to send DHCP request messages. But you can have problems with applications on your PCs if it takes 30 seconds for a PC to receive an IP address.  \\\\n\\\\nSo here again, the PC has got an IP address, but if I power cycle these devices while the switch is booting up and while the ports are transitioning through the Spanning Tree states are like they are now.  \\\\nSo again, back on the switch, the switch has no configuration. \\\\n\\\\nshow spanning tree\\\\nport is currently in the listening state and then should go to the learning state as you can see there and then will eventually go to the forwarding state. But during that time, PCs will not be able to receive IP addresses or forward traffic, a windows PC as an example, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to log on to the domain. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using one of these IP addresses instead of the IP address allocated by the DHCP server.  \\\\n\\\\nNow 169.254 dot something dot something is a IP version 4 link local address. \\\\nIn other words, an IP address in this range 169.254/16 is an IPv4 link local address. This is similar in concept to fe80::/10 in IPv6.  \\\\n\\\\nThe idea is that, if a PC doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get an IP address from a DHCP server, it will use an IP address in this range  so that 2 PCs can still communicate with one another if they for instance connected to a hub or a switch and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no DHCP server on the network....\"",

Alternatively, you can use port security to filter traffic that is destined to or received from a specific host that is based on the host MAC address.\\\\n\\\\nPort Security with Dynamically Learned and Static MAC Addresses:\\\\nYou can use port security with dynamically learned and static MAC addresses to restrict a port\\'s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. When you assign secure MAC addresses to a secure port, the port does not forward ingress traffic that has source addresses outside the group of defined addresses. If you limit the number of secure MAC addresses to one and assign a single secure MAC address, the device attached to that port has the full bandwidth of the port.\\\\n\\\\nA security violation occurs in either of these situations:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2When the maximum number of secure MAC addresses is reached on a secure port and the source MAC address of the ingress traffic is different from any of the identified secure MAC addresses, port security applies the configured violation mode.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2If traffic with a secure MAC address that is configured or learned on one secure port attempts to access another secure port in the same VLAN, applies the configured violation mode.\\\\n\\\\nAfter you have set the maximum number of secure MAC addresses on a port, port security includes the secure addresses in the address table in one of these ways:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2You can statically configure all secure MAC addresses by using the switchport port-security mac-address mac_address interface configuration command.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2You can allow the port to dynamically configure secure MAC addresses with the MAC addresses of connected devices.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2You can statically configure a number of addresses and allow the rest to be dynamically configured.\\\\n\\\\nIf the port has a link-down condition, all dynamically learned addresses are removed.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing bootup, a reload, or a link-down condition, port security does not populate the address table with dynamically learned MAC addresses until the port receives ingress traffic.\\\\n\\\\nA security violation occurs if the maximum number of secure MAC addresses have been added to the address table and the port receives traffic from a MAC address that is not in the address table.\\\\n\\\\nYou can configure the port for one of three violation modes: protect, restrict, or shutdown.

The DHCP snooping feature performs the following activities:\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Validates DHCP messages received from untrusted sources and filters out invalid messages.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Rate-limits DHCP traffic from trusted and untrusted sources.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Builds and maintains the DHCP snooping binding database, which contains information about untrusted hosts with leased IP addresses.\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Utilizes the DHCP snooping binding database to validate subsequent requests from untrusted hosts.\\\\n\\\\nOther security features, such as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI), also use information stored in the DHCP snooping binding database.\\\\n\\\\nDHCP snooping is enabled on a per-VLAN basis. By default, the feature is inactive on all VLANs. You can enable the feature on a single VLAN or a range of VLANs.\\\\n\\\\nThe DHCP snooping feature is implemented in software on the route processor (RP). Therefore, all DHCP messages for enabled VLANs are intercepted in the PFC and directed to the RP for processing.\\\\n\\\\nTrusted and Untrusted Sources\\\\nThe DHCP snooping feature determines whether traffic sources are trusted or untrusted. An untrusted source may initiate traffic attacks or other hostile actions. To prevent such attacks, the DHCP snooping feature filters messages and rate-limits traffic from untrusted sources.\\\\n\\\\nIn an enterprise network, devices under your administrative control are trusted sources.

Host ports and unknown DHCP servers are generally treated as untrusted sources.\\\\n\\\\nA DHCP server that is on your network without your knowledge on an untrusted port is called a spurious DHCP server. A spurious DHCP server is any piece of equipment that is loaded with DHCP server enabled. Some examples are desktop systems and laptop systems that are loaded with DHCP server enabled, or wireless access points honoring DHCP requests on the wired side of your network. If spurious DHCP servers remain undetected, you will have difficulties troubleshooting a network outage. You can detect spurious DHCP servers by sending dummy DHCPDISCOVER packets out to all of the DHCP servers so that a response is sent back to the switch.\\\\n\\\\nIn a service provider environment, any device that is not in the service provider network is an untrusted source (such as a customer switch). Host ports are untrusted sources.\\\\n\\\\nIn the switch, you indicate that a source is trusted by configuring the trust state of its connecting interface.\\\\n\\\\nThe default trust state of all interfaces is untrusted. You must configure DHCP server interfaces as trusted. You can also configure other interfaces as trusted if they connect to devices (such as switches or routers) inside your network. You usually do not configure host port interfaces as trusted.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo the PC is only getting IP addresses and the 10.1.1.0 range and that is the range of addresses on the enterprise DHCP server. The rogue DHCP server is allocating IP addresses in the 10.1.100 range. \\\\n\\\\nSo again, on both PC 1 and PC 2, we are only getting IP addresses in the 10.1.1.0 range. \\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s run simulation mode and see what happens. \\\\n\\\\nipconfig /renew\\\\nDHCP message is sent to the switch.

It is not the intention of Cisco to compete with RADIUS or influence users to use TACACS+. You should choose the solution that best meets your needs. This document discusses the differences between TACACS+ and RADIUS, so that you can make an informed choice.\\\\n\\\\nCisco has supported the RADIUS protocol since Cisco IOS\\xc2\\xae Software Release 11.1 in February 1996. Cisco continues to enhance the RADIUS Client with new features and capabilities, supporting RADIUS as a standard.\\\\n\\\\nCisco seriously evaluated RADIUS as a security protocol before it developed TACACS+. Many features were included in the TACACS+ protocol to meet the needs of the growing security market. The protocol was designed to scale as networks grow, and to adapt to new security technology as the market matures. The underlying architecture of the TACACS+ protocol complements the independent authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) architecture.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRADIUS uses UDP while TACACS+ uses TCP. TCP offers several advantages over UDP. TCP offers a connection-oriented transport, while UDP offers best-effort delivery. RADIUS requires additional programmable variables such as re-transmit attempts and time-outs to compensate for best-effort transport, but it lacks the level of built-in support that a TCP transport offers:\\\\n\\\\nTCP usage provides a separate acknowledgment that a request has been received, within (approximately) a network round-trip time (RTT), regardless of how loaded and slow the backend authentication mechanism (a TCP acknowledgment) might be.\\\\n\\\\nTCP provides immediate indication of a crashed, or not running, server by a reset (RST).

UDP cannot tell the difference between a server that is down, a slow server, and a non-existent server.\\\\n\\\\nUsing TCP keepalives, server crashes can be detected out-of-band with actual requests. Connections to multiple servers can be maintained simultaneously, and you only need to send messages to the ones that are known to be up and running.\\\\n\\\\nTCP is more scalable and adapts to growing, as well as congested, networks.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n \\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s run a simulation in packet tracer. \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go to simulation mode. \\\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the console of router 1 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll login with my username david, password is cisco. \\\\n\\\\nNotice I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m logging in to the console of the router but TCP packet is generated and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sent to the AAA server. Inbound PDU received by the server has a source of the router, destination is the AAA server; port number is 49. So this is a TACACS TCP packet. Packet goes back. A TACACS packet is now sent to the TACACS server. \\\\n\\\\nSo if I click on that, notice the inbound PDU shows us that the source of the packet is the router, destination is the TACACS server.  \\\\n\\\\nScrolling down in the TCP header, we can see that the destination is port 49. \\\\nThis is a TACACS packet.

First client is router 1, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to use this IP address, we will configure the router in a moment.  The secret password that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use here is cisco. The protocol used is TACACS. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to click add to add that client. \\\\n\\\\nNext client is router 2, IP address is 10.1.1.253\\\\nThe password used is cisco and in this case, it needs to be radius.  Switch 1, client IP address is 10.1.1.252 secret will be cisco. This device is going to use TACACS. \\\\n\\\\nWe then need to add a user, the user name is David the password is cisco.  So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the server configured. Server has an IP address once again of 10.1.1.250\\\\n\\\\nThe first device we need to configure is router 1. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s router 1. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just booted up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asking us whether we want to enter the initial configuration dialog. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do that. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to say no. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll configure the router with a hostname of R1.  \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to configure AAA for login and enable using TACACS with server 10.1.1.250\\\\nNow before we can do that, we need to make sure we have IP connectivity. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to configure the router with an IP address on gigabit 0/0/0 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to no shut the interface.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s per our network topology and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been given the IP address of the TACACS client. So we know the router needs to be configured with this IP address.  \\\\n\\\\nSo can the router ping the TACACS server 10.1.250?  Yes it can.  \\\\n\\\\nSo before we configure AAA , we need to ensure that we have IP connectivity on our devices. \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do something similar while I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here with the router 2. So host name is router 2 interface gigabit 0/0/0 no shut, IP address is 10.1.1.253 /24 mask.  \\\\n\\\\nCan we ping the AAA  server?\"",

Use your own name as the username and a password of cisco\\\\n\\\\nIn the solution video, as an example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simply going to use my name, David as the username. Make sure that you configure router 1 for AAA authentication for both login and enable using TACACS with the AAA  server 10.1.1.250\\\\n\\\\nThis AAA  server is configured with this IP address. \\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address you need to configure router 1 with for authentication both login and enable authentication. So when you test this, you should be prompted for your username when you log in to the console as well as when you type enable, make sure that you use local authentication as a backup in case the AAA  server is not available. Use a backup username of backup and a password of cisco\\\\n\\\\nYou then need to test that you can login using your own name. \\\\nSo essentially on all three devices, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to configure the AAA  server and ensure that you can log in to these three servers using your username and password which is not configured on these devices but is configured on the TACACS and radius server.  \\\\n\\\\nSo make sure that you can login to router 1. \\\\nDo something similar with router 2 but use radius as the authentication protocol. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll also configure switch 1 using TACACS and again make sure that you can login with your username and password....\"",

We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any class maps or we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see any policy maps on the router.  \\\\n\\\\nSo conf t we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that we need to match a voice traffic using NBAR and specifically RTP. \\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s create a class map and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use the name of voice. \\\\n\\\\nNow you can specify match all or match any. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to do that here but notice by default, match all is used. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only got a single match statement. So that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make any difference.  So what are we going to match? \\\\nIn this example we want to match a protocol. \\\\nThe protocol that we want to match is RTP. So we want to match Real Time Protocol. \\\\nBy doing that we are leveraging Network Based Application Recognition or NBARr on the router. \\\\n\\\\nWe now need to match HTTP traffic using NBAR and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to set the DSCP to AF 31.  \\\\n\\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s create another class map. \\\\nIn this case I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to match HTTP and again I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to say \\\\nmatch protocol http\\\\n\\\\nNext step is to match ICMP traffic using NBAR.\\\\nSo class-map icmp\\\\nYou could use any names here but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simply going to match based on the protocol. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make the class the same as the protocol. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created an HTTP class that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s matching HTTP. \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created an ICMP class that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s matching ICMP that have used the word voice to match RTP. You could use any descriptive name that you like for your class map.  \\\\nOkay so once we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created our class maps, the next thing we need to do is create a policy map and you need to give it a name. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to call this mark. \\\\n\\\\nIn the exam, follow the names that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to use. But here we can use really any name that we want to. We then we need to match a class that exists. So we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just specify something like test.  The class map test doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. We need to specify a class that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created such as voice and then we need to decide what to do with a voice traffic that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s matched. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to set the DSCP to EF. \\\\nSo set ip dscp and notice here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a list of DSCP values. \\\\nThis is very nice because we can see both the name as well as the binary representation of DSCP value.\"",

The network infrastructure must be designed to be highly available before you can successfully implement QoS. The target for High Availability is 99.999 % uptime, with only five minutes of downtime permitted per year. The transmission quality of the network is determined by the following factors:\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Loss\\xe2\\x80\\x94A relative measure of the number of packets that were not received compared to the total number of packets transmitted. Loss is typically a function of availability. If the network is Highly Available, then loss during periods of non-congestion would be essentially zero. During periods of congestion, however, QoS mechanisms can determine which packets are more suitable to be selectively dropped to alleviate the congestion.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Delay\\xe2\\x80\\x94The finite amount of time it takes a packet to reach the receiving endpoint after being transmitted from the sending endpoint. In the case of voice, this is the amount of time it takes for a sound to travel from the speaker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth to a listener\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ear.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Delay variation (Jitter)\\xe2\\x80\\x94The difference in the end-to-end delay between packets. For example, if one packet requires 100 ms to traverse the network from the source endpoint to the destination endpoint and the following packet requires 125 ms to make the same trip, then the delay variation is 25 ms.\\\\nEach end station in a Voice over IP (VoIP) or Video over IP conversation uses a jitter buffer to smooth out changes in the arrival times of voice data packets. Although jitter buffers are dynamic and adaptive, they may not be able to compensate for instantaneous changes in arrival times of packets. This can lead to jitter buffer over-runs and under-runs, both of which result in an audible degradation of call quality.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nIn this packet tracer lab, you need to configure Quality of Service or QoS \\\\nIn this lab we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to cover quality of service topics such as matching traffic, marking traffic, doing something with the traffic such as providing a minimum bandwidth guarantee.  \\\\n\\\\nNow in the real world, you would follow a quality of service policy document. In other words, you would decide which traffic types are important in your network and then allocate bandwidth accordingly or implement quality of service mechanisms such as policing, shaping, queuing and others based on your quality service policy document.  \\\\n\\\\nIn this lab, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to implement a basic quality of service policy. So that  you can get familiar with class maps, policy maps, service policies and other commands used for quality of service in CISCO environments.  \\\\n\\\\nOn router 1, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to match traffic using NBAR or Network Based Application Recognition and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to mark the traffic with DSCP values or Differentiated Services Code Point values. In addition you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use queuing on the egress interface. In other words on serial a 0/1/0 to prioritize voice traffic over other traffic types. \\\\n\\\\nVoice traffic will be in a priority queue HTTP and  ICMP traffic will be given a minimum bandwidth guarantee.  \\\\nYou need to do configuration on both router 1 and router 2. \\\\nOn router 1, you firstly need to match traffic. \\\\nYou need to match a voice traffic using NBAR and specifically RTP traffic or Real Time Protocol. You need to set the DSCP to EF for matched packets. So you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to match a voice traffic using NBAR and then mark the packets using DSCP and to set the marking to Expedited Forwarding or EF.  \\\\n\\\\nYou need to match HTTP traffic using NBAR and set the DSCP to AF 31 or shared forwarding  class AF 31.

The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails.\\\\n\\\\nAs the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree within a network of connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network nodes. STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation.\\\\n\\\\nIn 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as 802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster recovery in response to network changes or failures, introducing new convergence behaviors and bridge port roles to do this. RSTP was designed to be backwards-compatible with standard STP.\\\\n\\\\nSTP was originally standardized as IEEE 802.1D but the functionality of spanning tree (802.1D), rapid spanning tree (802.1w), and multiple spanning tree (802.1s) has since been incorporated into IEEE 802.1Q-2014.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nIs Spanning Tree important in switch networks? \\\\nWhat happens when you disable Spanning Tree? \\\\nDo you actually need Spanning Tree in a layer 2 Ethernet network?  \\\\n\\\\nOkay so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what happens. \\\\nAt the moment on both of these switches, a default configuration is being used.\\\\n\\\\nSo show spanning tree \\\\nshows us that Spanning Tree is enabled on VLAN 1. \\\\nOn switch 1, all ports are forwarding, switch 1 is the root of the Spanning Tree.  \\\\nSpanning Tree is also running on switch 2, on VLAN 1, the switch is not the root to switch. Interface gigabit 1/0/2 is blocking on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disable Spanning Tree\\\\nconf t no spanning-tree vlan 1 \\\\n\\\\nOn this side no spanning-tree on vlan 1\\\\nSo on switch 1 show spanning tree \\\\nshows us that Spanning Tree is disabled. \\\\n\\\\nOn switch 2 show spanning-tree \\\\nshows us that Spanning Tree is disabled. \\\\n\\\\nNotice all ports are now showing green. No ports are being blocked. \\\\nPlease note that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running in simulation mode in packet tracer and what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do now is send a ping from PC 1 to PC 2. \\\\nPC 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IP address is 10.1.1.2\\\\nThe MAC address of PC 2 is this. \\\\nOn PC 1, IP address is 10.1.1.1 MAC address is this. \\\\n\\\\nSo what happens if we ping PC 2?  \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending an ICMP message but the PC doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the MAC address of PC 2. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to send an ARP into the network which is a broadcast and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to try and find out the MAC address of PC 2.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to click capture forward. The ARP message is sent to the switch. Notice what happens, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sent to switch 2. Switch 2 however, duplicates the packet and floods it out of all ports. So it goes back to switch 1 on gigabit 1/0/1 and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s received by PC 2.  \\\\nSo PC 2 is receiving this broadcast and now PC 1 is receiving the broadcast that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sent. Notice the source MAC address is PC 1, destination is broadcast. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking for the MAC address of PC 2. So PC 1 will drop that packet. But notice, we now have multiple packets being flooded through the network. \\\\n\\\\nPC 1 has received the ARP message once again, so is PC 2. \\\\nSo PC 2 is receiving multiple ARP requests from the network. The switches are also duplicating packets.  When we look at the MAC address table of switch 2, we can see that PC 2 is found on gigabit 1/0/3 and PC 1 is found on gigabit 1/0/2\\\\n\\\\nCapture forward notice now the switch thinks that PC 2 is connected to gigabit 1/0/2, whereas in actual fact PC 2 is connected to gigabit 1/0/3. \\\\n\\\\nOnce again, this is the MAC address of PC 2.  \\\\nSo the switch is receiving conflicting information. \\\\nPreviously it thought that PC 2 is connected to this port. Now it thinks that PC 2 is connected to this port. \\\\n\\\\nCapture forward again. \\\\nNow it thinks that PC 2 is connected to gigabit 1/0/1\\\\nSo the switch previously thought that PC 2 is connected to 1/0/3 which is correct. \\\\nThen it thought that PC 2 is connected to 1/0/2 and now it thinks that PC 2 is connected to 1/0/1\\\\n\\\\nPreviously it thought that PC 1 is connected to 1/0/2, then to 1/0/1 and now to 1/0/2. \\\\nSo the MAC address table is constantly being updated. This is how broadcast storms happen in live networks, which can bring down an entire network. \\\\n\\\\nWe have duplication of packets, we have MAC address table instability, we have hosts receiving the packets that they sent out into the network such as here PC 1 receiving its own ARP request message..........\"",

This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826,[1] which is Internet Standard STD 37.\\\\n\\\\nARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies, such as IPv4, Chaosnet, DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet (PUP) using IEEE 802 standards, FDDI, X.25, Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). IPv4 over IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 is the most common usage.\\\\n\\\\nIn Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nOkay so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if we can answer these questions practically by using packet tracer. \\\\nThe first thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do is power cycle the devices to ensure that devices have just booted up.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to wait until all the links have done green before we can send a ping from PC 1. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC 1, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll open up a command prompt. IP address of this PC is 10.1.1.1; default gateway is 10.1.1.2.5.4 which should be ISR Router 1. \\\\nshow ip  interface brief \\\\nshows us the IP address of the router that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address of Router 1.  \\\\n\\\\nThe interfaces in packet tracer have now gone green. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go to simulation mode, edit the filters and make sure that only ARP and ICMP are enabled. \\\\n\\\\nBack on PC 1, we need to ping PC 2, in other words 10.1.3.2\\\\nWe can see in packet tracer that an ICMP message is being sent but PC 1 needs to know the MAC address of its default gateway. \\\\n\\\\nSo the PC is sending out an ARP request. We can see in the output that the source MAC address is this, destination MAC address is a broadcast, source IP address is PC 1; destination IP address is the router.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the outbound PDU, information we can see that this is an ARP request message from PC 1 to a broadcast address, source MAC address is this, source IP addresses is this, target IP addresses is this. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the target MAC address, so based on that, we can already answer some of the questions. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use capture forward to show that the message received by the switch and sent by the switch to the router looks the same. \\\\n\\\\nARP request message, destination is a broadcast address, source MAC address, source IP address, target MAC address, target IP address.  \\\\n\\\\nSo to answer some of the questions: \\\\nAt which points in the network are ARP messages sent? \\\\nSo we already know that at point A and it will be at point B. Notice the ARP message gets to the router. So the broadcast is received by the router but then the router is going to reply from its MAC address to the MAC address of PC 1. \\\\n\\\\nSo source MAC address is the router. We can verify that by looking at the interface on the router\\\\nso show interface gigabit 0.0.0\\\\n\\\\nNotice this is the MAC address configured on this interface.  I manually configured this MAC address on the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interface. \\\\nSo the ARP message sent back is from the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address to PC 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address and we can verify PC 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address by looking at the PC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configuration. \\\\nNotice the MAC address of PC 1.  \\\\n\\\\nSo ARP messages are sent at point A and B. The MAC address requested by ARP at point A is the MAC address of the router. We can verify that by going back and looking at the ARP request message sent by the PC. \\\\n\\\\nSo on the outbound PDU, we are requesting the MAC address of the route. \\\\nSo this is the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address. \\\\nWe can see the reply to that by using capture forward and looking at the ARP reply message.  \\\\n\\\\nThe ARP reply message shows us the MAC address of the router. \\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the MAC address that the PC will learn. \\\\n\\\\nWe can also answer question 5 which asks:\\\\n What is the destination layer 2 address of the ARP request at point A?  \\\\nSo the ARP request message at this point has a destination address of a broadcast. \\\\nSo question 5 is a broadcast address. So the answer to question 5 is a broadcast address....\"",

Wait for all links to turn green and then answer these questions. \\\\n\\\\nWhen PC 1 pings PC 2, at which points on the network are ARP message is sent? \\\\nSo will ARP requests and replies be sent at point A, point B, point C, point D or point E or all of them where are ARP message is used?  \\\\nSo what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your answer to that question?  \\\\n\\\\nQuestion 2, what is the MAC address requested by ARP at point A? \\\\nSo in other words, when PC 1 pings PC 2, what is the MAC address requested by PC 1 at point A?  \\\\nWhat is the MAC address requested by ARP at point C?  \\\\nWhat is the MAC address requested by ARP at point E?  \\\\nAnd for extra credits, you can also answer the question, what is the MAC address requested by ARP at point B and point D?  \\\\n\\\\nQuestion 5: What is the destination at layer 2 address of the ARP request at point A?  \\\\nSo what is the destination MAC address at this point?  \\\\nWhat is the destination layer 2 address of the ARP reply at point A?  \\\\n\\\\nNotice that it is different to question 5. You need to provide the answer for the ARP request and reply messages.  \\\\n\\\\nQuestion 7: What do layer 2 switches do with ARP request messages? \\\\nAssume that you have a single VLAN. \\\\nNow to help you answer these questions; use packet tracer simulation mode. \\\\nSo start simulation mode and enable packet tracer for ARP and ICMP and then on PC 1, send a ping to PC 2 and use packet tracer simulation mode to answer the questions.  \\\\n\\\\nSo look at the messages that are sent. \\\\nLook at the OSI model information. \\\\nLook at the inbound PDU and outbound PDU information and then answer these questions. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just answer the questions; verify that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re answering the questions correctly by using simulation mode and looking at the actual packets in the network.  \\\\n\\\\nSo can you answer these questions yourself? \\\\nDownload the attached packet tracer file and see if you can answer all these question yourself or otherwise watch the next video where I answer the questions.\"",

Can you prove the answers?\\\\n\\\\nA broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or switch is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. Routers and other higher-layer devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.\\\\n\\\\nThis is as compared to a collision domain, which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.\\\\n\\\\nWhile some layer two network devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nIn question 5, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to assume that Switch 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address is empty. \\\\nWe can verify that by looking at the output of the show MAC address table command on the switch. As we can see here the MAC address table is empty.  \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asked: \\\\nWhen PC 5 pings PC 8, what type of packet is sent to the switch initially and can we prove it?  So, ipconfig on PC 5 shows us the IP address of PC 5 is 10.1.1.5\\\\nPC 8 has IP address 10.1.1.8\\\\nSo what kind of frame or what kind of packet is sent to the switch? \\\\nWhen using terms such as frames and packets, once again, are we referring to layer 2 or layer 3 or layer 4 of the OSI model?\\\\n\\\\nSo what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do on PC 5 is ping 10.1.1.8\\\\nBefore I do that, notice the ARP cache is empty on PC 5. If it had just rebooted the ARP cache would be empty. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to send 2 pings into the network. We can see that the first packet that was generated is an ARP packet. Looking at the actual packet or frame, we can see that at layer 2 the frame has a destination address of a broadcast. The type of packet at layer 3 is ARP.  So in the layer 3 headers we can see that this is an ARP packet requesting the MAC address of host with IP address 10.1.1.8\\\\n\\\\nSo the Ethernet type is 0x0806\\\\nIn other words it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an ARP packet. \\\\nCapture forward and before I continue the answer to question 5 is this is an ARP packet?\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a broadcast packet. We can see that again by looking at the inbound PDU on the switch.  Notice destination address is a broadcast.  \\\\n\\\\nWho receives the packet because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a broadcast, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be flooded to the other devices in the network and then PC 6 and PC 7 are going to drop it because the packet is not destined to them.  So the answer for question 6 is PC 6, PC 7 and PC 8 will receive the packet.  \\\\n\\\\nNow here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where things change who receives the return packet? \\\\nSo here we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got our ARP reply on the inbound PDU to the switch we can see that the target MAC address is this. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the MAC address of PC 5. So the MAC address is actually written into the frame. This is a unicast packet sent from PC 8 to PC 5. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a broadcast unlike the ARP request.  \\\\nSo notice what happens now. The packet is only sent to PC 5. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not flooded out of all ports. \\\\nSo the only PC that receives it is PC 5. That is different to our previous example where PC 1, PC 2 and PC 3 received the return traffic.  \\\\n\\\\nAnd notice the difference in question 8: When ping traffic is sent from PC 5 to PC 8, who receives it? \\\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our ICMP requests or echo request message. We can see that its ICMP destination MAC address is PC 8, source MAC address is PC 5, source IP address is PC 5, destination IP address is PC 8. So notice now that the packet is only sent to PC 8. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very different to what we saw when we were using a hub. \\\\n\\\\nA switch is different to a hub in that, it has a separate collision domain on every port. \\\\nSo when packets are sent from PC 5 to PC 8, they are sent directly between the devices. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get flooded to the other PCs in the network. That is very different to a hub.  \\\\n\\\\nSo, to prove that, what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do is populate the ARP cache of PC 6. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get it to ping PC 8 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll run this in real time. So if we look at the ARP cache of PC 6 ARP cache is populated. The same is true on PC 5. So both PC 5 and PC 6 know the MAC address of PC 8....\"",

Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nWe can also answer this question: \\\\nHow many broadcast domains are there in Network 1?  \\\\nSo if I go back all the way to the original ARP message and then click capture forward, the ARP message is sent to the hub. \\\\nNotice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broadcast at Layer 2. \\\\nSo what happens to broadcast traffic? It gets flooded.  \\\\nSo we have one broadcast domain because a broadcast sent to a hub is flooded. \\\\n\\\\nSo single broadcast domain in Network 1. We can also prove that by rerunning a simulation. \\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rerun the simulation.  \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only going to look at ARP ICMP traffic. But on PC 1, what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do now is send a broadcast to 10.1.1.255\\\\n\\\\nSo this is a broadcast, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll only send two packets. \\\\nNotice the broadcast traffic is sent to the hub. When we look at the packet source address is PC 1. We can see that again by looking at the MAC address. \\\\nSo notice the MAC address is PC 1.  \\\\nDestination is a broadcast. \\\\nSo the destination MAC address is set to that. \\\\nDestination IP address is set to a broadcast 255.255.255 in packet tracer, source IP address is PC 1. \\\\nNotice the broadcast goes to everyone. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a single broadcast domain. These devices will reply back but the traffic is flooded out of all ports. Notice we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting a collision here. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll reset the simulation and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at another problem if PC 1 sends a ping to PC 4 and PC 2 sends a ping to PC 4, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen.  \\\\nSo they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re both sending packets into the network. \\\\nIn this example, PC 2 sent an ARP because it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the MAC address of PC 4. \\\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the actual frame. \\\\n\\\\nA quick recap of terminology to be precise and to be correct for the CCNA exam at Layer 1 in the OSI model, we talked about bits, at Layer 2 in the OSI model we talked about frames, at Layer 3 we talked about packets and at layer 4 we talked about segments and then we typically talk about data at higher layers.  \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m often using terms interchangeably here, but if you want to very precise about terminology, at Layer 1 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bits, Layer 2 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frames, Layer 3 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s packets, at layer 4 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s segments.  \\\\n\\\\nSo notice at Layer 2 the frame has a destination address of a broadcast. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s causing problems with the frame that was sent by PC 1. \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got collision taking place here. So there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem with the frames because of the collisions. Only one device can access the network at anytime.  \\\\n\\\\nSo here, PC 1 is sending the ICMP message and a reply is sent back to PC 1. \\\\nSo run the simulation again. \\\\nBefore I do that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make sure that PC 2 can ping PC 4. So make sure that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ARP cache is populated. So both PC 2 and PC 1 have PC 4\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address in the ARP cache. And then what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do in simulation mode is get PC 1 to ping PC 4 and get PC 2 to ping PC 4. So they both going  to send an ICMP packet. \\\\n\\\\nWhen that hits the hub, we have a collision. You have a single collision domain when you have a hub. So a hub is a single broadcast domain as well as a single collision domain.  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have problems with lots of collisions taking place as you add more and more devices to a hub. So be careful with hubs. There are single collision domains and single broadcast domains.  \\\\n\\\\nSo we can say question 11, Network 1 equals a single collision domain. Be careful using hubs....\"",

Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nOkay so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if we can practically answer these questions. \\\\nTo do that, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to use simulation mode in packet tracer and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to change the filters to only show up an ICMP messages. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see all the other traffic types in the network. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what happens when PC 1 pings PC4. \\\\nPC 1 has an IP address of 10.1.1.1\\\\nPC 4 has an IP address of 10.1.1.4\\\\nSo we are going to send ICMP traffic. In other words ping traffic from PC 1 to PC 4 and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to observe what happens. \\\\n\\\\nNow in this example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll only send 2 packets, in other words two pings. Notice what happens in the network. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ICMP traffic but there is also an ARP frame that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s generated. \\\\nPC 1 needs to learn the MAC address of PC 4. So it sends out an ARP which is a broadcast requesting the target MAC address of PC 4.  \\\\n\\\\nSo in answer to our first question: What type of packet is sent initially? \\\\nThe answer is a ARP packet which is a broadcast packet.  \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve proven that, by running simulation mode in packet tracer. \\\\nNow this is a broadcast and in this network, the devices are connected to a hub. So the traffic should be flooded to all devices in the network except the device that sent to the packet.  \\\\n\\\\nSo who receives the packet?\\\\nPC2 does, PC3 does and so does PC4. \\\\nPC2 and PC3 will drop the packets because the ARP packet is not for their IP address. \\\\nPC2 as an example is configured with IP address 10.1.1.2\\\\nSo PC2 is going to drop other packet. The ARP request is for IP address 10.1.1.4\\\\nSo both PC2 and PC3 drop the packet but PC4 will accept the packet. \\\\n\\\\nAnd what it should do now he sent back on ARP reply.  So if we look at this packet, notice the inbound packet to the hub. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an ARP reply packet with the MAC address of PC4. \\\\nThis is PC4\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IP address, this its MAC address. We can verify that by using the ipconfig command and I should say\\\\n\\\\nipconfig/all\\\\nNotice the MAC address which is the source MAC address of the frame and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the source MAC address we see over here.  \\\\n\\\\nSo the next question is who receives the return traffic?  \\\\nSo if I click capture forward, notice PC1, PC3 and PC2 receive the return traffic. \\\\nSo PC1 PC2 and PC3, PC2 and PC3 will drop the ARP reply because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not destined to them. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we look at that packet, we can see that the destination MAC address is PC1 and we can confirm that by looking at the config of PC1..........\\\\n\\\\nNotice the MAC address is this. So PC2 and PC3 will drop the ARP reply.  \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re then asked when ping traffic is sent from PC1 to PC4, who receives the traffic? \\\\nNow it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hub, so the traffic will be flooded. \\\\n\\\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the ICMP message. \\\\nWe can see that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an Ethernet 2 frame using IP4 at Layer 3 and we can see it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an ICMP packet and when we click capture forward, notice PC2, PC3 and PC4 receive the traffic. But again PC2 and PC3 will drop the packet because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not destined to them.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen we look at the inbound PDU or Protocol Data Unit on PC4, we can see that the destination IP address is PC4 and the destination MAC address is PC4. \\\\n\\\\nWe can verify that once again by using the ipconfig/all command and we can see the MAC address of PC4.  \\\\n\\\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to continue now. \\\\nWhen PC4 replies to PC1 the traffic is flooded and this is the problem with a hub even though the conversation is between PC1 and PC4, everyone in the network receives the traffic.\"",

Can you prove the answers?\\\\n\\\\nA broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or switch is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. Routers and other higher-layer devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.\\\\n\\\\nThis is as compared to a collision domain, which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.\\\\n\\\\nWhile some layer two network devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.\\\\n\\\\nTranslation:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple CCNA quiz based videos. \\\\nThese quizzes are practical and use packet tracer to help you test and verify your knowledge of CCNA topics.  \\\\n\\\\nSo download the attached packet tracer file and see if you can practically answer the questions in these quizzes. \\\\nSo don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just answer the questions, prove it by using the packet tracer simulation mode. \\\\nSo assume that for these questions that all devices have just rebooted.  \\\\nYou can simulate this by clicking the power cycle devices button in packet tracer. \\\\nIn other words, you can click this button here to power cycle the devices. \\\\nAgain, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just answer these questions, prove it.  \\\\n\\\\nThe first question is, when PC 1 pings PC 4 in network 1, what type of packet is sent to the hub initially? \\\\nCan you prove it?  \\\\nWho received the packet?  \\\\nWho received the return traffic from PC 4 to PC 1 and when ping traffic is sent from PC 1 to PC 4, who receives that traffic?  \\\\n\\\\nFor question 5 to 8, assume that the switches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 MAC address table is empty. \\\\nSo assume that this layer 2 switch in network 2 has just rebooted and that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address table is empty.  When PC 5 pings PC 8, in other words this PC here pings the IP address of PC 8.  \\\\nWhat type of packet is sent initially to the switch and can you prove it?  \\\\nAnd then again, who received the initial packet and who received the return traffic from PC 8 to PC 5?  \\\\nAnd then when ICMP traffic or ping traffic is sent from PC 5 to PC 8, who received the traffic? \\\\n\\\\nQuestion 9,10 and 11 asked about broadcast and collision domains. \\\\nHow many broadcast domains are there in network 1 and can you prove it? \\\\nHow many broadcast domains are there in network 2 and can you prove it?  \\\\nHow many collision domains are there in network 1 and network 2 and again can you prove that?  \\\\n\\\\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to answer these questions from question 1 to question 11. You may want to answer questions 9,10 and 11 first and then answer the other questions. But by the time you finished, you should be able to answer these 11 questions and be able to prove the answers practically.  \\\\n\\\\nSo download the attached packet tracer file and see if you can answer the questions yourself. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now going to go through the answers to these questions.\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to answer the questions practically now, so either pause the video or continue watching.\"",

Use the tftpdnld [-r] command to download the image.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told in this network that the operating system of the router has been lost.  Clicking on the router, I can see that the router has booted into ROM monitor mode. \\\\n\\\\nHelp shows us various commands that we can use in rommon mode. One of them is dir  and we can look at the flash of the router. \\\\n\\\\nAt the moment no files are available in flash.  \\\\nIf I use the command reset, the boot process fails and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re back in rommon  mode. \\\\n\\\\nHelp again shows us various commands that are available. One of those is TFTP download which allows us to download an image from a TFTP server.  \\\\n\\\\nIn this network, we have a TFTP server which has the operating system. The TFTP server has an IP address of 10.1.1.100\\\\n\\\\nSo again, ip config  shows us the IP address of the TFTP server. \\\\n\\\\nSo we should be able to connect to the TFTP server via the switch that assumes that the ports on the switch are in the same VLAN.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on the switch, show IP interface brief \\\\nthis port is up, this is port connected to the TFTP server. This port is down. This port is connected to the router. \\\\n\\\\nYou can view that by going to options, preferences, show port labels and that will show you the port labels in the diagram. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to turn that off. But if you prefer, you can display the port labels.  \\\\n\\\\nSo again, this is the port interface connected to the router. This is the interface connected to the server. \\\\n\\\\nshow run\\\\nallows us to view the running configuration. We can see that portfast is enabled on this port. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important because when the router boots up, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to try and connect to the TFTP server and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the routers connection to timeout. \\\\n\\\\nSo we want the port on the switch to start forwarding immediately.  \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll run the TFTP download command. Notice the help that is going to give us, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quite bit of help. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that we need to enter some information to use the command. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also told to only use this command for disaster recovery when recovering an image from a TFTP server, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want to do.  \\\\n\\\\nIn this lab, we need to configure some variables using this syntax and we can use the set command to show the current of variables. These variables are required. These are optional. \\\\n\\\\nSo set at the moment shows us that only that option is currently configured. \\\\nSo what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is copy IP address and paste that into the router and sent the IP address of the router to a value such as 10.1.1.1\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m setting it to 10.1.1.1 because the TFTP server has its default gateway configured with IP address and the switch is configured with this IP address.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to use 10.1.1.1\\\\n\\\\nYou just need to make sure that you have IP connectivity. So use an IP address in the same subnet.  Subnet mask will be set to 255.255.255.0 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the subnet used on the TFTP server, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the subnet used on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nSo you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to configure the router in the same subnet as the TFTP server or configure a default gateway that has IP connectivity to the TFTP server.....\"",

Do you know how MAC addresses are used? When they are used? How they change? \\\\nGet ready for the CCNA exam\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if we can answer the questions. \\\\nIn the scenario we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that PC 1 pings PC t2 and we need to answer these questions based on the echo request message sent from PC 1 to PC 2. \\\\n\\\\nSo we firstly asked: \\\\nWhat is the destination MAC address in the frame at point A in the Network?  \\\\nWhen traffic is sent from one layer to a network across the router, the PC is going to ARP for the routers MAC addresses and encapsulates the frame with the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address when sending traffic to a remote destination.  \\\\n\\\\nSo the MAC address that will be used is the MAC address of the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gigabit is 0.0.0 interface which is configured as this. \\\\nSo the answer to the question is E Router 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gigabit 0.0 MAC address.  \\\\n\\\\nSo I would say for the question one the answer is E, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verify that by using simulation mode in packet tracer. \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to edit my filters to only show up in ICMP traffic. You can click this option show all and then uncheck the various traffic types that you want to view.  \\\\nOn PC 1, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to send a ping to the IP address of PC 2 and in the output here, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to view the ICMP traffic.  \\\\n\\\\nSo the inbound PDU shows us that the destination MAC address is the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MAC address which is configured as follows. \\\\nSo again, answer to question 1 is the router is gigabit 0.0.0 address is the MAC address used as the destination MAC address in the frame and that address is this.  So that would be the answer for question 2 which is asking us for the destination MAC address.  \\\\n\\\\nQuestion 3 asks us what is the encapsulation used? \\\\nNotice the encapsulation is Ethernet 2. So eth 2 is the encapsulation used\\\\nAt point A in the network, we can see that again in the packet tracer capture.  \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re then asked to do something similar at point B in the network. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll click capture forward. We could actually look at that under the frame on the switch and look at the outbound PDU. Notice the destination MAC address is the same Ether type is Ethernet 2. This is the MAC address of the router. \\\\n\\\\nSo the answers here would be very similar. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not asked in this example for the encapsulation used, but the encapsulation used is Ether 2. \\\\n\\\\nSo we could look at that here or we could look at the inbound PDU on the router and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice it has the same information. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the answers to questions 1 to 5. \\\\n\\\\nWe then need to answer the question: \\\\nWhat is the destination MAC address at point C in the network? In other words, over here.  \\\\n\\\\nSo looking at the outbound PDU, what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice is there is no MAC address. \\\\nThe encapsulation used on the serial interface is HDLC. HDLC doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use MAC addresses. MAC addresses are used in Ethernet. So we could see that here or as the inbound PDU on Router 2.  So inbound PDU show something very similar. Notice the encapsulation used is HDLC, there is no MAC address. \\\\n\\\\nSo the answer to question 6 is, there is no MAC address at Point C in the Network and the encapsulation used is HDLC. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re then asked similar information at pointed D in the Network.  So what is the destination Mac address? \\\\nWhat is the actual MAC address and what is the encapsulation used at Point D?  \\\\n\\\\nSo, D over here. So we could look at the router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outbound PDU. MAC address is this is. \\\\nThat is the MAC address of the PC.\\\\n\\\\nSo ipconfig\\\\nshows us the IP address of the PC\\\\n\\\\nipconfig/all \\\\nshows us the destination MAC address of the PC. \\\\n\\\\nSo this is the actual MAC address used.  Going back to our questions, we need to specify whose MAC address is in the destination frame at point D that is PC 2 MAC address. This is the actual MAC address and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re back on Ethernet which means it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be Ethernet 2 as the encapsulation. We can verify that by looking at the outbound PDU on the router, notice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ethernet 2.  \\\\n\\\\nSo this is going to be Ethernet 2. Once again we could also if we wanted to look at the ingress traffic on the switch. Ingress shows something very similar. Destination MAC address frame type is Ethernet 2.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually going to the same on this link. So on E, we could either look at the packet outbound on the switch. Notice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same or we could look at the ingress PDU on the PC....\"",

Do you know how MAC addresses are used? When they are used? How they change? \\\\n\\\\nGet ready for the CCNA exam.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple CCNA exam simulation quiz questions. \\\\n\\\\nCan you answer the questions yourself? \\\\nIn these quiz questions I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using Cisco packet tracer to help you practically test and verify your knowledge of Cisco CCNA topics.  \\\\n\\\\nIn these quiz questions; we are testing your knowledge of the life of a packet. \\\\nDo you understand destination and source of MAC addresses? \\\\nDo you understand where those are used? \\\\nDo you understand how traffic flows through a network and the various encapsulations used in a network? \\\\n\\\\nIn this scenario I have two PCs, PC 1 on the left and PC 2 on the right. \\\\nThey are connected to 3650 switches. These switches are configured as Layer 2 switches. There are also 2 Cisco ISR routers connected via a serial link. \\\\n\\\\nThe scenario is: PC 1 pings PC2. \\\\nYou need to answer the following questions based on the echo request message sent from PC1 to PC2.  So, look at the echo request message, not other traffic  types and answer these questions.  \\\\n\\\\nWhat is the destination MAC address of the frame at point A in the network? \\\\nIn other words, what is the destination MAC address of the echo request message at this point?  \\\\n\\\\nWhat is the actual destination MAC address? \\\\nSo in other words, you need to determine what the actual MAC address is by looking at the frame and determining to which device that MAC address belongs. \\\\n\\\\nNow to help you with this task, in packet tracer, use the simulation mode.  Simulation mode in packet tracer allows you to simulate the flow of traffic through a network and view what happens. Once you open up simulation mode on PC 1, generate traffic. So send the ping to the IP address of PC 2 which is 10.1.3.2 and have a look at how the traffic flows. \\\\n\\\\nAs we can see here an ARP packet has been created and the PC is ARPing for the MAC address of the router. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see other traffic types, you can edit your filters to only look at ARP and ICMP traffic within packet tracer.  \\\\nSo what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do is reset that simulation and send the packet again. \\\\nSo we can see the ARP request to the router and the reply and then we can see the ICMP message and if you click on the message, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll able to view the inbound PDU and outbound PDU and then answer the questions.  \\\\n\\\\nSo by using simulation mode or by simply looking at the configurations of the devices in the topology, you should be able to answer these questions. \\\\n\\\\nSo there are various questions asking about MAC addresses and encapsulations used at different stages in the life of the packet for both echo request and echo reply.  \\\\n\\\\nDo you know how packets are encapsulated?  \\\\nDo you know when MAC addresses are used and when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not used?  \\\\n\\\\nDownload the attached packet tracer file and see if you can answer these questions yourself, otherwise watch the next video, we will show you the answers to these questions.\"",

So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to ping PC 2 from PC 1; that works. But what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do now is go into simulation mode and then I can do the ping again. Notice the packet is queued on PC 1 to be sent out of the router, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the packet looks like. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a source IP address of 10.1.1.2 destination of 10.1.2.2 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correct. The local IP address of this PC is 10.1.1.2 and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending traffic to the remote PC 10.1.2.2\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to click capture forward packet is sent to the router and this is what the packet looks like on the router, inbound PDU it looks like this or inbound Protocol Data Unit looks like this. Traffic is coming from PC 1 going to PC 2 but on outbound, notice source IP address is Customer Router 1, destination IP address is Customer Router 2.  \\\\n\\\\nAnd on egress or outbound out of the router, now have a GRE header and a encapsulated IP header. So the original inbound Protocol Data Unit or inbound information, this IP information is encapsulated inside an external header. \\\\n\\\\nSo going right to the top, Ethernet 2, this is an Ethernet link between Customer Router 1 and ISP 1. External IP header is this. Encapsulated in that we have GRE and we have the encapsulated original IP packet.  Click capture forward, on this router something very similar happens. Notice inbound PDU contains the outer headers of Customer Router 1 talking to Customer Router 2 with the encapsulated original IP packet.\\\\n\\\\nOutbound something very similar is going to be used but what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice is the MAC addresses will change. So from one interface to another, on the router, the source MAC address will change because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending the traffic across a separate Ethernet link.\\\\n\\\\nWhen it gets to this router, something very similar, all that happens here is the MAC addresses are being changed, other  information changes but we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry too much about that.  The big thing to note is the routers are routing based on the external IP headers.\\\\n\\\\nIt gets to Router 3, something very similar, inbound PDU is still using these IP addresses and so is the outbound PDU or Protocol Data Unit. When it gets to this router however, things change.  So on this router, inbound PDU has the eight network IP addresses and the encapsulated IP addresses. But the outbound PDU has the GRE information stripped. \\\\n\\\\nSo what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice is inbound, we have these IP addresses. We have the GRE header and we have the internal IP packet information. But outbound, there is no GRE and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see Network 8 in the list of IP addresses.  The outer headers have been removed from the packet and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the client is going to see. \\\\n\\\\nThe client PC only sees the RFC 1918 addresses. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see Network 8 and these routers on the Internet use network 8.  So, if I go back to see this router here and look at to the packet, notice inbound PDU and outbound PDU both are using public IP addresses. But if I go back again to this router, this is where the encapsulation is taking place.  Inbound PDU contains RFC 1918 addresses, outbound PDU has public IP addresses, a GRE header and the original encapsulated packet.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen we go forward to here, packet is being encapsulated. So inbound we have IP header , GRE IP header but outbound we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the public IP addresses,  we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the GRE headers. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been stripped. So headers are added here, headers are removed here.  \\\\n\\\\nSo how did you get on? Were you able to complete the lab?  Did you get your GRE tunnel up and running?\"",

We\\'ll use 0 as the tunnel number. IP address that we\\'ll use is 10.1.3.1/24 mask. In the real world, you probably want to use a /30 mask to conserve IP addresses. But we don\\'t need to worry about that for the lab. \\\\n\\\\nWe then need to specify a tunnel source. In this case the tunnel source will be gigabit 0/0/1\\\\nNow you don\\'t have to use the local interface. As the source, you could specify the local router\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IP address if you want to but I\\'ve used the interfaces in this example. \\\\n\\\\nThe tunnel destination will be the router on the other side which is Router 2. \\\\nNow in this a lab, the routers are using DHCP addresses on the internet facing interfaces. \\\\nIn the real world you\\'re going to want to use static IP addresses because if these addresses change, your tunnels will break. But that\\'s okay for this lab. \\\\n\\\\nThe tunnel interface has come up because the local router has IP reachability to the destination. That doesn\\'t mean that the tunnel is going to work because we need to still configure the other side. So the tunnel is up now.\\\\n\\\\nOn Router 2 interface tunnel 0\\\\nIP address to use is 10.1.3.2/24 mask\\\\nTunnel source is going to be the local interface gigabit 0/0/1\\\\nTunnel destination is going to be Customer Router 1 with IP address 8.8.10.2\\\\nTunnel has come up on the side. \\\\nSo can we ping 10.1.3.1? In other words, can we ping from the local tunnel interface to the remote tunnel interface? It took it a while but that\\'s working now. \\\\n\\\\nSo ping 10.1.3.2 we can ping from this tunnel interface to this tunnel interface and back again. But notice that the call routers don\\'t know about that network. So show IP route, this router only knows about Network 8, it doesn\\'t know about Network 10. The traffic is being encapsulated on the Internet. \\\\nSo what we\\'ve done thus far is configure a GRE tunnel. The two routers can ping each other but we now need to advertise these networks via EIGRP, otherwise the routers will not know about the internal networks behind the other router. \\\\n\\\\nAs an example, Router 2 knows about Network 10.1.2\\\\nThis network 10.1.3.0 the tunnel subnet but it doesn\\'t know about network 10.1.1.0\\\\n\\\\nCustomer Router 1 also knows about 10.1.3.0\\\\nIt knows about 10.1.1.0 but it doesn\\'t know about network 10.1.2.0\\\\n\\\\nSo we need to configure EIGRP autonomous system 100. \\\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do that and enable EIGRP on Network 10 and disable automatic summarization. \\\\n\\\\nWe were told to use EIGRP as the routing protocol on Router 2. \\\\nDo something similar router eigrp 100 \\\\nnetwork 10\\\\nno auto summary \\\\nand as you can see there, a neighbor relationship was established. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\'ve got a new adjacency. \\\\nSo on Router 2\\\\nshow ip eigrp  neighbors\\\\nWe\\'ve got a neighbor relationship to Customer Router 1 through the tunnel. \\\\n\\\\nshow ip route\\\\nthis router has now learned about network 10.1.1.0\\\\nSo it should be able to ping 10.1.1 which it can. \\\\n\\\\nSo Router 2 can ping this IP address through the tunnel. Notice the difference when I do a trace. \\\\n\\\\nSo traced to 10.1.1.1\\\\nwe don\\'t see the Internet routers. It looks like these two routers are directly connected to each other which they logically are through the GRE tunnel.....\"",

We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that we need to configure the customer routers to use DHCP addresses on the Internet interfaces and static IP addresses on the internal interfaces.  \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start with customer router 1. \\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go to configuration mode and then go on to gigabit 0/0/1\\\\n\\\\nThe interface is currently shut. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going no shut at the interface and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll configure an IP address using DHCP. \\\\n\\\\nAs you can see an IP address has been allocated via DHCP, an IP address of 8.8.10.2 has been allocated. \\\\n                                                                                                                                                        I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go on to interface gigabit 0/0/0 no shut the interface and configure an IP address of 10.1.1.1/24\\\\n\\\\nSo show ip interface brief\\\\nwe can see that both interfaces are up, up. \\\\n\\\\nThis is the IP address on the Internet facing interface. \\\\nThis is the IP address on the inside interface.  Internet address was assigned via DHCP. Internal or customer facing interface IP address was configured manually. \\\\nThat happens because the ISP routers are configured as DHCP servers.  \\\\n\\\\nSo show ip dhcp binding\\\\nwe can see that this IP address was allocated to this MAC address. \\\\n\\\\nNow we see a DHCP conflict here and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because IP address 8.8.10.1 is part of the DHCP pool all IP addresses in this subnet are but the router has this IP address configured on this interface. \\\\n\\\\nSo the ISP doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allocate its own IP address to the client but allocate the next IP address in the pool.  \\\\nSo again, show ip interface brief on the customer router. This IP address was allocated via DHCP and the router can ping the ISP router.  \\\\n\\\\nI can do something similar on customer 2. \\\\nSo customer router 2\\\\n\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nboth interfaces are administratively  shut down.\\\\n \\\\nSo interface gigabit 0/0/1 no shut ip address dhcp\\\\ninterface gigabit 0/0/0 and while I was typing that an IP address was allocated via DHCP to the router. \\\\n\\\\nIP address on gigabit 0/0/0 is 10.1.2.1/24 mask\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll no shut that interface\\\\n\\\\nSo show ip interface brief\\\\nboth IP addresses are configured, one dynamically and one statically. \\\\n\\\\nshow ip route \\\\nshows us the routing table notice a gateway of last resort has been configured and the router also has a default route to its ISP. \\\\n\\\\nSo ping 8.8.11.1\\\\nThe router can ping its default gateway or ISP router.  \\\\nCan it ping customer router 1? \\\\nSo ping 8.8.10.2  Yes it can. \\\\n\\\\nWe could do a trace as an example to that address and you can see that the traffic is going via the Internet. In other words traffic is traversing these links to get to customer router 1. \\\\n\\\\nAs an example, the second hop is this IP address, third hop is this IP address.  \\\\nSo we have IP connectivity between customer 1 and customer 2. \\\\n\\\\nThe next step is to configure a DHCP pool on the customer routers to allocate IP addresses to the PCs in the network. \\\\n\\\\nSo on customer router 1\\\\nconf t ip dhcp pool \\\\nand you could call it as anything and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just going to call it PC.  \\\\n\\\\nIn the exam, follow the instructions. \\\\nBut here, there is a little bit of leeway. You can decide what you want the pool name to be. Network is going to be this; subnet mask is going to be that. \\\\nDefault router will be 10.1.1.1\\\\n\\\\nSo show ip dhcp binding\\\\nwe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any bindings yet.  \\\\n\\\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s look at the PC. So on its configuration; we need to configure it to use DHCP.\\\\n\\\\nGo to desktop, command prompt\\\\nipconfig\\\\nnotice it has an IP address of 10.1.1.2 ping 10.1.1.1\\\\nPC can ping customer router 1. \\\\n\\\\nAnd on the customer router, we can see again that there was an address conflict. So the router allocated 10.1.1.2 rather than 10.1.1.1 to the client. \\\\n\\\\nYou could create an exclusion range for your pool if you want to make sure that a separate range of addresses are used for the client PCs. \\\\n\\\\nWe need to do something similar on customer router 2\\\\n\\\\nso conf t ip dhcp pool pc \\\\nnetwork 10.1.2.0 with the mask /24 mask, default router will be 10.1.2.1\"",

If you want the added benefit of GRE encrypted tunnels, you typically encapsulate a GRE tunnel over an IPSec tunnel.  \\\\n\\\\nIPSec provides the encryption. GRE allows you to encapsulate multiple protocols and run routing protocols across the GRE tunnel.  \\\\n\\\\nCisco devices now support many types of tunnels such as DMVPN and others but GRE is one of the oldest and most simple tunnelling technologies. \\\\n\\\\nIn this lab, you need to configure a GRE tunnel from Customer 1 to Costumer 2 via the Internet routers in the topology. \\\\n\\\\nThere are three Internet routers: ISP Router 1, ISP Router 2 and ISP Router 3. Each of these routers is running BGP in a separate autonomous system.  The BGP configuration has already been completed and as you can see here is ISP Router 2 has 2 BGP relationships. \\\\n\\\\nSo show ip bgp summary \\\\nshows us that the router has 2 BGP relationships to one relationship to ISP 1 and another to ISP 3. \\\\n\\\\nHere are the lists of tasks that you need to complete in this lab. \\\\nYou need to configure customer routers CI and C2. In other words, this router and this router to use DHCP IP addresses on gigabit 0/0/1 and static IP addresses as shown in the diagram on gigabit 0/0/0\\\\n\\\\n The ISP routers ISP 1 and ISP 3 have been configured with DHCP and these routers will allocate IP addresses to the customer routers. So you need to configure these interfaces with DHCP and these interfaces with static IP addresses. You then need to configure a DHCP pool on the customer routers to allocate IP addresses to the PCs. \\\\n\\\\nSo on customer router 1 and customer router 2, create a DHCP pool and allocate IP addresses to the PCs in these subnets. \\\\n\\\\nEnsure that the PCs learn about their default gateways. In other words PC 1\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default gateway will be Customer Router 1. PC 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default gateway will be Customer Router 2.  \\\\n\\\\nYou then need to configure a GRE tunnel between C1 and C2 so that PC1 and PC2 can ping each other using RFC 1918 address. Network 10 is an RFC 1918 address.\\\\n\\\\nSo these PCS will need to be able to ping each other via the GRE tunnel. \\\\nUse a tunnel interface of tunnel 0 on both customer 1 and customer 2 and use IP addresses of 10.1.3.1 and 10.1.2.3.2 on the tunnel interfaces.  \\\\n\\\\nTo enable routing between customer site 1 and customer site 2, you need to enable EIGRP an autonomous system 100 and advertise this network via GRE tunnel to customer router 1 so that the router and the PC can ping both this IP address as well as PC 2.  \\\\n\\\\nThis network also needs to be advertised via EIGRP through the GRE tunnel so that customer 2 and PC 2 and can ping both this IP address and PC 1. \\\\n\\\\nSo as verification, make sure that the customer routers can ping each other on the gigabit 0/0/0 interfaces and that PC1 and PC2 can ping each other.  \\\\n\\\\nThese routers in the Internet such as ISP 2 will not learn about the 10 network. They should only know about 8.8.X.X networks.  \\\\n\\\\n10.0.0.0/8 is an RFC 1918 or private address\\\\n\\\\nSo we are going to tunnel private addresses through the Internet via a GRE tunnel so that these devices can ping each other even though the ISP routers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about those networks.  \\\\n\\\\nSo can you complete this lab?  \\\\nDownload the attached packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab yourself, otherwise watch the next video where I complete the lab.\"",

Cisco Systems offers many technology solutions for building a custom security solution for Internet, extranet, intranet, and remote access networks. These scalable solutions seamlessly interoperate to deploy enterprise-wide network security. Cisco System\\'s IPsec delivers a key technology component for providing a total security solution. Cisco\\'s IPsec offering provides privacy, integrity, and authenticity for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet.\\\\n\\\\nIPsec provides secure tunnels between two peers, such as two routers. You define which packets are considered sensitive and should be sent through these secure tunnels, and you define the parameters which should be used to protect these sensitive packets, by specifying characteristics of these tunnels. Then, when the IPsec peer sees such a sensitive packet, it sets up the appropriate secure tunnel and sends the packet through the tunnel to the remote peer.\\\\n\\\\nMore accurately, these tunnels are sets of security associations (SAs) that are established between two IPsec peers. The security associations define which protocols and algorithms should be applied to sensitive packets, and also specify the keying material to be used by the two peers. Security associations are unidirectional and are established per security protocol (AH or ESP).\\\\n\\\\nWith IPsec you define what traffic should be protected between two IPsec peers by configuring access lists and applying these access lists to interfaces by way of crypto map sets. Therefore, traffic can be selected based on source and destination address, and optionally Layer 4 protocol, and port. The access lists used for IPsec only determine which traffic should be protected by IPsec, not which traffic should be blocked or permitted through the interface. Separate access lists define blocking and permitting at the interface.\\\\n\\\\nA crypto map set can contain multiple entries, each with a different access list. The crypto map entries are searched in order\\xe2\\x80\\x94the router attempts to match the packet to the access list specified in that entry. It is good practice to place the most important crypto map entries at the top of the list.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a packet matches a permit entry in a particular access list, and the corresponding crypto map entry is tagged as cisco, then CET is triggered, and connections are established if necessary. If the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-isakmp, IPsec is triggered.\\\\n\\\\nIf no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to negotiate with the remote peer to set up the necessary IPsec security associations on behalf of the data flow. The negotiation uses information specified in the crypto map entry as well as the data flow information from the specific access list entry.\\\\n\\\\nIf the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-manual, IPsec is triggered. If no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, the traffic is dropped. In this case, the security associations are installed via the configuration, without the intervention of IKE. If the security associations did not exist, IPsec did not have all of the necessary pieces configured.\\\\n\\\\nOnce established, the set of security associations (outbound, to the peer) is then applied to the triggering packet as well as to subsequent applicable packets as those packets exit the router. Applicable packets are packets that match the same access list criteria that the original packet matched. For example, all applicable packets could be encrypted before being forwarded to the remote peer. The corresponding inbound security associations are used when processing the incoming traffic from that peer.\\\\n\\\\nIf IKE is used to establish the security associations, the security associations will have lifetimes set so that they periodically expire and require renegotiation, thus providing an additional level of security.\\\\n\\\\nMultiple IPsec tunnels can exist between two peers to secure different data streams, with each tunnel using a separate set of security associations.

So we need to connect to the console of the device. \\\\n\\\\nNow in packet tracer we can either do that by dragging a PC into the topology and then connecting it via a console cable. So I could connect to the console of the switch and have a look.  At the switch directly through the console password here is unknown. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to do it that way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m simply going to click on the device which gives me a console connection anyway. \\\\n\\\\nBut please be aware that in the real world, you need to physically connect a PC to the console of your switch or router when doing password recovery.  \\\\n\\\\nNow the next step is to make sure that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using 9,600 bits per second in your terminal emulation software, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the default in packet tracer. We need to power the off the switch and then reconnect the power cord and then within 15 seconds press the mode button while the system LED is still flashing green. Continue pressing the mode button until the system LED turns briefly amber and then solid green and then release the mode button.  \\\\n\\\\nNow in my example, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t physically unplug the power through packet tracer. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to power cycle the devices that power cycles all the devices but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already reset the configuration of my routers so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to press the mode button on the switch which then allows me to access ROM on under the switch.  \\\\n\\\\nAnd now some tips, if that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work, power cycle device and then click the mode button two or three times, to get packet tracer to take you to ROM monitor mode.  \\\\n\\\\nSo notice now that the boot process was terminated, question mark enter shows me that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in ROM monitor mode. Now that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got into ROM monitor mode, we need to use the command flash in it, so here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the command flash init\\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that the flash is already initialized so be aware that packet tracer may be a little bit different to the real world. This command as an example is not required and is not supported in packet tracer. So the next command is to look at flash.  \\\\n\\\\nSo dir flash\\\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the contents of flash on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to rename the config text file as config text old. So there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our config text file. \\\\n\\\\nSo rename flash:config.text flash:config text.old\\\\nBefore I press enter, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verify that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told do, so that looks right, press enter \\\\n\\\\ndir flash\\\\n\\\\nThe file has been renamed, so that was the original name, this is the new name. \\\\nNow in the real world, when you boot to the switch it will take you to the initial configuration dialog.  So boot, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if that actually works in packet tracer. What we should be able to do is now bypass the configuration and type enable and then rename the config back to what it was. \\\\n\\\\nCopy the configuration, reset passwords and save the configuration and then reload the switch.  So for the real world, have a look at the Cisco documentation for your relevant device. \\\\n\\\\nIn packet tracer however, the original configuration has been applied so that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work entirely. So what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is erase the startup configuration we do have the startup configuration in flash. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that here but if I go back to the physical device view and power cycle the device and press the mode button, notice in flash I can see the original configuration. \\\\n\\\\nSo I could use that to replace the running config on the switch. So what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is boot the switch and then once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s booted, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to erase the NVRAM.  \\\\n\\\\nSwitch has now booted up again, enable doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work,I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to erase the NVRAM that actually has taken me directly to privilege mode in packet tracer that wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen in the real world.\"",

Cisco Systems offers many technology solutions for building a custom security solution for Internet, extranet, intranet, and remote access networks. These scalable solutions seamlessly interoperate to deploy enterprise-wide network security. Cisco System\\'s IPsec delivers a key technology component for providing a total security solution. Cisco\\'s IPsec offering provides privacy, integrity, and authenticity for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet.\\\\n\\\\nIPsec provides secure tunnels between two peers, such as two routers. You define which packets are considered sensitive and should be sent through these secure tunnels, and you define the parameters which should be used to protect these sensitive packets, by specifying characteristics of these tunnels. Then, when the IPsec peer sees such a sensitive packet, it sets up the appropriate secure tunnel and sends the packet through the tunnel to the remote peer.\\\\n\\\\nMore accurately, these tunnels are sets of security associations (SAs) that are established between two IPsec peers. The security associations define which protocols and algorithms should be applied to sensitive packets, and also specify the keying material to be used by the two peers. Security associations are unidirectional and are established per security protocol (AH or ESP).\\\\n\\\\nWith IPsec you define what traffic should be protected between two IPsec peers by configuring access lists and applying these access lists to interfaces by way of crypto map sets. Therefore, traffic can be selected based on source and destination address, and optionally Layer 4 protocol, and port. The access lists used for IPsec only determine which traffic should be protected by IPsec, not which traffic should be blocked or permitted through the interface. Separate access lists define blocking and permitting at the interface.\\\\n\\\\nA crypto map set can contain multiple entries, each with a different access list. The crypto map entries are searched in order\\xe2\\x80\\x94the router attempts to match the packet to the access list specified in that entry. It is good practice to place the most important crypto map entries at the top of the list.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a packet matches a permit entry in a particular access list, and the corresponding crypto map entry is tagged as cisco, then CET is triggered, and connections are established if necessary. If the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-isakmp, IPsec is triggered.\\\\n\\\\nIf no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to negotiate with the remote peer to set up the necessary IPsec security associations on behalf of the data flow. The negotiation uses information specified in the crypto map entry as well as the data flow information from the specific access list entry.\\\\n\\\\nIf the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-manual, IPsec is triggered. If no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, the traffic is dropped. In this case, the security associations are installed via the configuration, without the intervention of IKE. If the security associations did not exist, IPsec did not have all of the necessary pieces configured.\\\\n\\\\nOnce established, the set of security associations (outbound, to the peer) is then applied to the triggering packet as well as to subsequent applicable packets as those packets exit the router. Applicable packets are packets that match the same access list criteria that the original packet matched. For example, all applicable packets could be encrypted before being forwarded to the remote peer. The corresponding inbound security associations are used when processing the incoming traffic from that peer.\\\\n\\\\nIf IKE is used to establish the security associations, the security associations will have lifetimes set so that they periodically expire and require renegotiation, thus providing an additional level of security.\\\\n\\\\nMultiple IPsec tunnels can exist between two peers to secure different data streams, with each tunnel using a separate set of security associations. For example, some data streams might be just authenticated while other data streams must both be encrypted and authenticated.\\\\n\\\\nGo here for more: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/vpn_solutions_center/2-0/ip_security/provisioning/guide/IPsecPG1.html\"",

Once again, I need a physical access to the device, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to turn the power off and turn it back again and press CTRL C to break. \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in ROM monitor again, question mark enter, shows me options, help does something similar, confreg  allows me to set the configuration register 2142 is what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to set it to and then reset allows me to get the router to reboot.  \\\\n\\\\nRouter is now rebooting and will hopefully reboot without a startup configuration applied. In other words the startup configuration installed is still there but as you can see here is not applied to the running configuration.\\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bypass the initial configuration dialog. Again I can go to enable or privilege mode and use commands such as show run to see a default configuration. \\\\n\\\\nMake sure that you go to privileged mode before you copy the startup configuration. Notice the startup configuration has the secret password set. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what that password is.  We can see some other configuration on the router but note, I went from user mode to privilege or enable mode and now I can copy the startup configuration to the running configuration and apply it without knowing what the password is.  \\\\n\\\\nSo show run now shows us that password, and shows us configuration of interfaces and EIGRP. I still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the secret password is but I can now simply type enable secret cisco to override the secret password.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save the configuration. \\\\n\\\\nWhat I still need to do however is enable interfaces that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not done by default. So no shut the various interfaces on the router. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually need to no shut gigabit 0/0/1 down, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not part of the lab. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll shut that again.  \\\\n\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\nthere are our device IP addresses, interfaces are up \\\\n\\\\nshow ip protocols\\\\nwe are running EIGRP\\\\n\\\\nshow ip eigrp  neighbor\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a neighbor relationship to router 1. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if we can ping the loopback of router 1.  So on router 1\\\\n\\\\nshow ip interface brief \\\\nmy IP address is 1.1.1.1\\\\n\\\\nSo on router 2, ping 1.1.1.1\\\\nThat works. Router 1 can ping the loopback of router 2.  \\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good idea to save your configuration often. Again for the exam you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going do it this way, WR may not work in the exam.  \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verify that when we exit and log back in. We can log in with a password of cisco and we are able to do that in this example. So that works. \\\\n\\\\nNow again, just because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve saved the configuration of the router doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that things are going to work. I need to set the configuration register to 0X2102. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now done.  \\\\n\\\\nAgain, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to save the configuration once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve set the configuration register, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s separate parameter. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve reset the enable password of router 1 to cisco and the secret password of router 2 to cisco. Now I need to reset the password of the switch.\"",

The previous administrator at your company was fired and he was the only one who knew the passwords of these devices.  Unfortunately, the company doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a document with company passwords locked in a safe or stored somewhere securely. The passwords of these devices were only known by the now fired network administrator and you need to fix this.  \\\\n\\\\nSo in this lab, you need to do a password reset on Router 1, Router 2 and to Switch 1. You need to reset the enable passwords of Router 1, Router 2 and of the switch to Cisco.  Now that in itself is not good advice for the real world. In the real world, you obviously are going to use a better password thancisco.\\\\n\\\\nBut for this lab, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sufficient.  Now to help you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve added a link to Cisco documentation. For the real world, you should learn to use Google as well as the Cisco documentation for troubleshooting networks.  \\\\n\\\\nThis first document is a troubleshooting guide for the Cisco 4000 series, integrated services router and the second link is recovering from a lost or forgotten password on the 3560 software configuration guide documentation.  \\\\n\\\\nSo use the documentation to help you if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure how to recover password. Now one thing to note is that packet tracer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fully support all the options for password recovery on a Cisco switch. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve tried to make it as close as possible to the real world example. \\\\n\\\\nSo if you need to watch the next video where I demonstrate how to solve the lab that the router password recovery will be as per the documentation on the Cisco website. So use this to help you if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sure. \\\\n\\\\nHow do you recover passwords by for instance going into ROM monitor and changing the configuration register? But for the switch the documentation on Cisco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website its, excellent and will help you a lot. But you may need to watch my video to get it to work fully in packet tracer.  \\\\n\\\\nNow once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve recovered the passwords, make sure that you restore the device configurations. So don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lose the device configurations. You should be able to bypass the secret and enabled passwords on the devices and restore the configuration.  \\\\n\\\\nOn Router 1, we are using an enable password. So you need to set that to cisco on Router 2 and of the switch set the secret password to cisco. \\\\n\\\\nSo make sure that you reset the right password. In the real world you want to use the secret passwords and not enabled passwords. But for the lab and for studying, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do an example of both.  \\\\nSo again, make sure that device configurations are restored and that devices can ping the loopbacks. Verify also that when devices are reloaded, configurations are restored using the new passwords. \\\\nSo click on power cycle devices. Once you think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got everything working and make sure that the devices reboot configurations are loaded correctly and that the passwords are set to cisco per these instructions.  \\\\n\\\\nSo can you complete the lab?  Download the attached packet tracer file and see if you can complete the lab yourself otherwise watch the next video where I complete this lab\"",

Cisco\\'s IPsec offering provides privacy, integrity, and authenticity for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet.\\\\n\\\\nIPsec provides secure tunnels between two peers, such as two routers. You define which packets are considered sensitive and should be sent through these secure tunnels, and you define the parameters which should be used to protect these sensitive packets, by specifying characteristics of these tunnels. Then, when the IPsec peer sees such a sensitive packet, it sets up the appropriate secure tunnel and sends the packet through the tunnel to the remote peer.\\\\n\\\\nMore accurately, these tunnels are sets of security associations (SAs) that are established between two IPsec peers. The security associations define which protocols and algorithms should be applied to sensitive packets, and also specify the keying material to be used by the two peers. Security associations are unidirectional and are established per security protocol (AH or ESP).\\\\n\\\\nWith IPsec you define what traffic should be protected between two IPsec peers by configuring access lists and applying these access lists to interfaces by way of crypto map sets. Therefore, traffic can be selected based on source and destination address, and optionally Layer 4 protocol, and port. The access lists used for IPsec only determine which traffic should be protected by IPsec, not which traffic should be blocked or permitted through the interface. Separate access lists define blocking and permitting at the interface.\\\\n\\\\nA crypto map set can contain multiple entries, each with a different access list. The crypto map entries are searched in order\\xe2\\x80\\x94the router attempts to match the packet to the access list specified in that entry. It is good practice to place the most important crypto map entries at the top of the list.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a packet matches a permit entry in a particular access list, and the corresponding crypto map entry is tagged as cisco, then CET is triggered, and connections are established if necessary. If the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-isakmp, IPsec is triggered.\\\\n\\\\nIf no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to negotiate with the remote peer to set up the necessary IPsec security associations on behalf of the data flow. The negotiation uses information specified in the crypto map entry as well as the data flow information from the specific access list entry.\\\\n\\\\nIf the crypto map entry is tagged as ipsec-manual, IPsec is triggered. If no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer, the traffic is dropped. In this case, the security associations are installed via the configuration, without the intervention of IKE. If the security associations did not exist, IPsec did not have all of the necessary pieces configured.\\\\n\\\\nOnce established, the set of security associations (outbound, to the peer) is then applied to the triggering packet as well as to subsequent applicable packets as those packets exit the router. Applicable packets are packets that match the same access list criteria that the original packet matched. For example, all applicable packets could be encrypted before being forwarded to the remote peer. The corresponding inbound security associations are used when processing the incoming traffic from that peer.\\\\n\\\\nIf IKE is used to establish the security associations, the security associations will have lifetimes set so that they periodically expire and require renegotiation, thus providing an additional level of security.\\\\n\\\\nMultiple IPsec tunnels can exist between two peers to secure different data streams, with each tunnel using a separate set of security associations. For example, some data streams might be just authenticated while other data streams must both be encrypted and authenticated.\\\\n\\\\nGo here for more: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/vpn_solutions_center/2-0/ip_security/provisioning/guide/IPsecPG1.html\"",

(Rx-boot)\\\\nThe boot image is a subset of the Cisco IOS\\xc2\\xae software that is used to download main Cisco IOS software images to the router using TFTP in recovery situations. The user can interact with this image through a command line interface signified by the prompt Router(boot)#. Some platforms (Cisco 1600, 2500) have it in ROM; others (high-end routers) have it in bootflash. This image can be called xboot image, rxboot image, bootstrap image, or boot loader or helper image, which depends on your platform.\\\\n\\\\nThe boot image has limited capabilities.

The network is down, the bosses in arms, users are complaining, they cannot access the really important site such as Facebook.com and YouTube.com. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your job to fix the network.  \\\\n\\\\nThis is a packet tracer troubleshooting lab. \\\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that after a power outage the network has stopped working entirely. Assume that this is just a portion of the network where issues are occurring.  \\\\n\\\\nNotice as an example that on Router 3 we see an issue, file boot failed, file not accessible, boot of test bin failed\\\\n\\\\nerror returned: file boot failed, file not accessible, there is error on file open.\\\\nThe router cannot load test.bin and that seems to occur multiple times.  \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that no valid boot image is found and the router is going to attempt autoboot from the default boot device. \\\\n\\\\nNow this is important to simulate this network issue. Click the power cycle devices button in packet tracer. In other words, click here and click yes to restart the devices.  Notice on router 2 as an example the network is broken. We are in ROM monitor mode. \\\\n\\\\nOn router 1, the router seems to be booting up. But let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if it boots successfully and on router 3 we have this issue where the router cannot find test.bin. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if this router boots up successfully.  \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that the network is broken. We can already see  a problem on router 2. We we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in ROM monitor mode for some reason. We need to fix that and then we need to check what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening on other routers. \\\\n\\\\nNotice we end up with the system configuration dialog and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asked do we want to enter the initial configuration dialogue. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really where we want to end up and notice on router 3 all interfaces are administratively shut down and the router doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any IP addresses. \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve established that there are problems in the network. Remember in this lab, click this option power cycle devices to simulate the power outage in the network.  \\\\n\\\\nYou now need to fix the issues and ensure that configurations are restored properly so that the routers can ping each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loop backs. \\\\n\\\\nRouter 1 should be able to ping its own local loopback, router 2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loopback and router 3\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loopback.  \\\\nNow you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve asked for network documentation but to make matters worse there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s none for this site. In other words, you are blind when configuring the network. You need to somehow restore the device configurations and get the network working. \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you a hint; however Router 1 has loopback of 1.1.1.1 router 2 of 2.2.2.2 and router 2 of 3.3.3.3\\\\n\\\\nThe routers are using EIGRP as the routing protocol in autonomous system 100. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the information you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been given.  You are not allowed to manually configure the loopbacks and the routing protocols. You need to restore device configurations. Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done that, you need to verify that things are working again. \\\\n\\\\nAs I like to say, routers do what you tell them to do not what you want them to do. In other words, they only do what they are configured to do.  \\\\n\\\\nSo verify things by using the power cycled devices button. Once you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve restored your device configurations and make sure that the router comes up again with their configurations and that the loopbacks are pingable. In other words, you need to fix the network so that if a power outage happens again in future, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to break the network.\"",

Labs include both configuration as well as troubleshooting labs.\\\\n\\\\nAsk yourself these questions:\\\\n- Are you ready and prepared for the labs in the CCNA exam?\\\\n- Are you able to troubleshoot Cisco networks?\\\\n- Are you confident with your ability to configure networks as required by Cisco to pass the CCNA?\\\\n\\\\nAnswer:\\\\nThis course helps you prepare for the exam and gain the confidence to pass the exam!\\\\n\\\\nThere are many topologies and many labs in this course!\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is an ACL or Access Control List lab.  \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told that we need to restrict traffic internally using Router 1 as follows. \\\\nOne of the big decisions to make is where are you going to bind the access list. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told to bind it in the most efficient place on Router 1.  \\\\n\\\\nIn these examples, we are restricting traffic from the user PCs. The most efficient place to bind the access list would be here gigabit 0/0/0\\\\n\\\\n That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want other router to have to process the traffic and then simply drop it on the outbound interface.  Extended access lists allow us to be very granular and we are able to specify individual traffic types and port numbers when permitting or denying traffic. \\\\n\\\\nSo this is where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bind the access list. We generally want to bind extended access lists as close to the source as possible to stop a devices having to process the traffic and then simply drop it.  \\\\n\\\\nNow firstly we need to permit traffic from PC1 to HTTP server 1 using HTTP. \\\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s our router. \\\\n\\\\nshow ip interface brief\\\\n\\\\nWe can see the IP addresses on the router. The router has been configured with IP addresses already.  This PC has an IP address of 10.1.2.101\\\\nNow for the real world and for the exam, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget the command ipconfig that also shows you the IP address of the PC. \\\\n\\\\nSo it has an IP address of 10.1.2.101\\\\nThis server has an IP address of 10.1.1.100\\\\nSo we want to permit traffic from this IP address to this IP address but only permit HTTP. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been told which access list number to use so that makes it simple. \\\\n\\\\nRemember, extended access lists have this range. \\\\nStandard IP access lists have this range. \\\\nNow if you check with us on the real device, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll notice that there are actually additional numbers.  \\\\n\\\\nSo in this example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll telnet to a real physical router that I have and if I type access-list?\\\\nNotice standard access list in the range 1 to 99 but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also this range which is called the expanded range. \\\\n\\\\nIP extended access list are in this range. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also this expanded range of  extended IP access list for the exam. Those are the two most important ranges to know and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we have in packet tracer.  \\\\n\\\\nSo on the router access list 100 and we are going to permit specific traffic. First we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using TCP here because HTTP resides on top of TCP. Now the source address is going to be a host 10.1.2.101 \\\\nso, 10.1.2.101\\\\n\\\\nNow we could use greater than but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do that here.  The destination is our server 10.1.1.100 so 10.1.1.100\\\\n\\\\nWe need to specify the port number which in our example is going to be 80 HTTP. \\\\n\\\\nSo now, do show run pipe include access. \\\\nNotice this line access list 100 permit TCP host 10.1. 2.101 host 10.1.1.100 equal www.  \\\\n\\\\nSo the router has automatically converted to port number to a word which is fine, so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first access list entry.\"",

We need to configure the router to get an IP address via DHCP from the ISP. \\\\n\\\\nSo on this interface you need to enable DHCP so that the router gets an IP address from a DHCP server.  \\\\n\\\\nYou then need to configure the router to allocate IP addresses via DHCP to the clients based on this information. The network to use is 10.1.1.0 /24\\\\n\\\\nThe default gateway is the router 10.1.1.1.254 the DNS server is going to be 8.8.8.8 \\\\nSo you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to configure this interface with a static IP address as follows and configure the router to allocate IP addresses to the PCs in this subnet, you need to configure the router so that internal hosts can access the internet using NAT or to be specific Port Address Translation or PAT. \\\\n\\\\nIn other words you need to NAT these internal hosts to the IP address  of the router on gigabit is 0/0/1\\\\n\\\\nNow please note that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had feedback that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not giving all of the details or not telling you exactly what to do.  \\\\n\\\\nNow I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m purposely doing that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to get you to make your own decisions about the best way to implement a network.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important that when you study for the CCNA exam that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just memorize things. You need to understand what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing and hopefully these labs will force you to do that they will get you to think about what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing and to troubleshoot any mistakes that you make.  \\\\n\\\\nIf you want to step by step process of configuring the lab, watch the next video but otherwise try and do this yourself.  Download the attached Packet Tracer file and see if you can do it yourself.  See these labs as challenges to ensure that you have the knowledge to pass your CCNA exam but also to gain real world knowledge that you can implement right away.  \\\\n\\\\nSo download the Packet Tracer file. See if you can do it otherwise watch the next video where I complete this lab.\"",

This video discusses creating Cisco networks in GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nGNS3 offers multiple ways to emulate IOS. For older images, we use and maintain Dynamips; an emulator dedicated to emulate some Cisco hardware. Dynamips can run unmodified IOS images. In the new GNS3 1.4, there is a way to run a second category of switches and routers. These are classified as Routing and Switching virtual machines (or R+Svms) for short. What are the differences? Here are the major differences:\\\\n\\\\n- IOS images are usually run in Dynamips however R+Svms are housed in a virtual machine.\\\\n- IOS images are lower in cpu and memory so you can fit more of them in one topology.\\\\nR+Svms are all vendor Routing and Switching images that are larger in size but can be imported into GNS3 for real world network emulation\\\\n\\\\nDynamips: Dynamips is the technology leveraged by GNS3 since inception and emulates Cisco routers and basic switching using the Etherswitch module. It emulates older Cisco hardware such as 3725 routers and uses actual Cisco IOS images. You can copy a supported IOS image from a  physical network device and use it with GNS3.\\\\n\\\\nYou will need access to either physical hardware or have a Cisco support contract to get an IOS image. GNS3 is unable to provide IOS images for your labs.\\\\n\\\\nCisco does not support you using IOS images on non-Cisco hardware and you may run into bugs emulating Cisco hardware.\"",

    "desc": "This video explains and demonstrates how to create your first GNS3 network in GNS3. This is one of multiple videos showing you how to install the GNS3 Windows GUI on a Windows 10 PC. \\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video in this series, I showed you how to download and install GNS3 on a Windows 10 computer.  \\\\n\\\\nNow that we\\'ve got GNS3 installed, let\\'s start it up and create our first GNS3 topology.\\\\nWhen GNS3 starts up for the first time, we see the setup wizard. I\\'m not going to use this wizard, so I\\'m going to click cancel. \\\\n\\\\nThe GNS3 software now starts up and as we can see here, it\\'s successfully\\\\nstarted. I\\'m going to click file, new blank project to start my first GNS3 project. So call this anything you want.\\\\n\\\\nMy project files are by default stored here. You can change the location of the files if you want to. Click OK \\\\n\\\\nThe GNS3 GUI consists of various components. On the left hand side, we can browse for various devices in our GNS3 topology. As an example, if I click browse routers, I can see available appliances, installed appliances and installed and available appliances. By default no appliances are installed. \\\\n\\\\nBut I can install various appliances from the GNS3 marketplace by simply dragging them to the workspace in GNS3. This white area is called the GNS3 workspace.\\\\n\\\\n I can also look at various switches by default. I have an ATM switch Ethernet, hub Ethernet switch and frame relay switch installed. But various other switches are available under End devices. I have a cloud, net cloud and VPCS installed by default. But again, there are many End devices available from the GNS3 marketplace.\\\\n\\\\nI can also browse security devices by default. No security appliances are installed, but many are available including the Cisco ASAV. Browse all devices, shows me all devices that are available.  At the moment these are the devices that I have installed. But as you can see here, there is a long list of devices that can\\\\nbe installed in GNS3. So I\\'m going to go to installed devices.\\\\n\\\\nAnd to start off with, I\\'m going to create a very basic GNS3 topology consisting of one Ethernet switch and two VPCS devices. VPCS devices are very basic PCs that you can use to test your GNS3 installation. The add a link button allows you to add connections to your GNS3 topology. I\\'m then going to add a link from the VPCS devices to the Ethernet switch.\\\\n\\\\nIn subsequent videos, I\\'ll show you how to add a Cisco IOS image to your GNS3 topologies but initially all I want to do is test that GNS3 is installed correctly. You can move devices around in your topology. You can show interface labels, you can also add various notes to your topology to make it look nicer.\\\\n\\\\nSo move things around and change the look and feel as you like. As an example, you could go to edit, preferences and change the style of your GNS3. Some screenshots that you see on internet may look like this. Windows by default uses the classic GNS3 style which looks like this.\\\\n\\\\nNow in subsequent videos, I\\'ll show you how to create a more complex GNS3 topologies. But initially, all we want to do here is prove that GNS3 has installed properly and that you can get your GNS3 working on your computer using a basic GNS3 topology. What I\\'m going to do now is start up the devices in my GNS3 topology and open up consoles to the devices.\\\\n\\\\nNow even though the Ethernet switch has a console, we\\'re not going to initially configure that. So what I\\'m going to do is do some basic configuration on my VPCS PCs. To make this easier to read, I\\'m going to\\\\nchange the putty settings. So I\\'ll make this bigger, so that it\\'s easier to read. \\\\n\\\\nSo here\\'s PC1 and I\\'ll do something similar on PC2. Change the appearance of the console \\\\n\\\\nOkay, so PC1 PC2. On PC1, I\\'ll configure an IP address of 10.1.1.1 with a /24 mask\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll do something similar on PC2 to IP address 10:1.1.2 / 24 mask\\\\n\\\\nNow that that\\'s been done, I should be able to ping from one PC to the other. \\\\nSo on PC2 - can I ping PC1? The answer is yes I can.\\\\n\\\\nOn PC1 can I ping PC2 - yes I can.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ve proven now that GNS3 has installed successfully. I can start it up and create a project,  add devices to my GNS3 topology. Configure them and get to them to talk to one another. That\\'s the first thing you want to do when you install GNS3 for the first time. Just prove that a basic install of GNS3 works. Once you\\'ve done this, you can extend your GNS3 topologies. I\\'ll drag a third PC to the topology and connect it to the Ethernet switch.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll right-click on the device and click start to start it up, right-click, click console to open up a console to the PC. I\\'ll change the console settings and I\\'ll configure this PC with an IP address of 10.1.1. 3 /24 mask\\\\n\\\\nAnd let\\'s verify whether it can ping PC1 - it can. What about PC2? It can....\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

    "desc": "This video explains and demonstrates how to install the GNS3 Windows GUI on a Windows 10 PC. This is one of a series of videos showing you how to get started using GNS3 on Windows.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nIn this video, I\\'m assuming that you\\'re just starting with GNS3 in other words\\\\nyou are new to the GNS3 platform and need to learn how to download, install\\\\nand configure GNS3 from the beginning. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s get started leveraging the power of GNS3.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example once again, I\\'m going to download and install GNS3 on the Windows PC.\\\\nThe minimum requirements for your PC can be found on the GNS3 website.\\\\nSo if you\\'re running an older computer, go to the GNS3 .com website. Click on Documentation and do a search for minimum requirements to ensure that your PC meets the minimum requirements for running GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nYou need at least a Windows 7 64 bit or later you need two or more logical cores. You need to have a virtualization extensions enabled. You need 4 gig of RAM. You need at least 1 gig of a disk space. Now that is a minimum requirement.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s recommended however that you have at least 8 gig of RAM and 4 or more logical cores.\\\\n\\\\nWhen building GNS3 topologies, you can build a very large topologies. The larger the topologies and the more system resources that individual devices in your topology requires, the greater\\\\nthe requirements will be for your PC. So in an optimum setup, you\\'ll have at least 16 gig of RAM and an i7 CPU with four or more logical cores. \\\\n\\\\nRequirements  depend on the devices that you want to add to your network and the size of your\\\\nGNS3 network. But here again are the minimum requirements. So make sure that you meet the minimum requirements.\\\\n\\\\nTo download a GNS3, go to GNS3.com and click on the free download button. GNS3 is open source free software but you need to create an account to download the software. If you don\\'t have an account, simply register to create an account. It\\'s once again free. If you do have an account, click on login and enter your username and your password to login. Click login and continue to log in. \\\\n\\\\nNow again, GNS3 consists of two main components: the GNS3 GUI and the GNS3 VM. In this video, we\\'re going to download the GNS3 GUI. In subsequent videos, I\\'ll show you how to download and integrate the GNS3 VM. GNS3 supports Windows Linux and Mac.\\\\n\\\\nIn this video, I\\'m going to download the GNS3 GUI for Windows. I\\'m going to click Save to save the file to my local computer. So wait for the file to download and once downloaded you can click on open folder.\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see here, the GNS3 2.1 all-in-one executable has been downloaded to my local computer. \\\\n\\\\nTo install it, simply double-click on the application, click yes to allow the app to make changes to your device. The GNS3 installation wizard is displayed. Now in this example, I\\'m going to stay mostly with the defaults. so I\\'m going to click Next Next Next Next to install GNS3. If you\\'re unsure, go with the defaults. \\\\n\\\\nGNS3 is again open source software. Open source software gives you a lot of options. So you can change the way GNS3 works. But again, if you\\'re new to GNS3, go with the default options. \\\\nI\\'m going to click Next. \\\\n\\\\nGNS3 is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It\\'s free\\\\nopen-source software. you don\\'t have to pay for GNS3. You may have to pay for some of the operating systems that GNS3 allows you to add in networking topologies. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, you may have to pay for a VIRL license to get access to a SAV images or Cisco IOSv and IOSv layer 2 images. But the core GNS3 software is free and open source. If you accept the terms of the GNU public license, click agree, choose your start-up and menu folder. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m going to stay with the defaults and click Next. GNS3 consists of multiple components. Some of these components are required such as WinPCAP and the core GNS3 software. Other components such as the SolarWinds, response time viewer are optional. You don\\'t need that. Refer to the GNS3 documentation if you want to learn more about the various components listed here.\\\\n\\\\nNow please be aware that the initial download doesn\\'t include all of these components. So if you select a Wireshark and SolarWinds response time viewer, they will be downloaded automatically as you proceed through this GNS3 installation wizard. So if your internet connection is poor or you pay per mega bandwidth be careful. Additional software is going to be downloaded such as Wireshark and the SolarWinds response time viewer as you go through this installation wizard.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to reduce the amount of software that\\'s downloaded, uncheck the SolarWinds response time viewer and uncheck Wireshark. However, be aware that if you uncheck those options you obviously won\\'t be able to use the features of those software components in\\\\nyour GNS3 topologies....\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

Router 1 needs to be configured to do inter VLAN routing between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 and thus will act as a route on a stick.  \\\\n\\\\nIn this topology you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll need to do the full configuration of this lab to get things working. \\\\nVLAN 1 is going to be configured with subnet 10.1.1.0 /24    \\\\nVLAN 10 with a subnet 10.1.10.0. /24   that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the VLAN, that PC 1 belongs to you and VLAN 20 is going to use subnet 10.1.20 0 /24 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the subnet that PC 2 belongs to.  \\\\n\\\\nYou need to configure the router with the last IP address in each subnet. So configure it with the last IP address in VLAN 1 10 and 20.  The switch is going to be configured with IP address 10.1.1.253/24 only. In other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only going to have a management IP address.  \\\\n\\\\nVLAN 1 is our management VLAN,  VLAN 10 and 20 or our user VLANS, we need to configure the VLANS on the switch. So again PC 1 needs to be configured in VLAN 10, PC 2 in VLAN 20 we need to configure the link between the switch on the router so we need to configure this link properly.  We need to configure these two links properly and then we need to make sure that PC 1 can ping PC 2, PC 2 can ping PC 1 and can ping the router.  \\\\n\\\\nFor additional credit configure the network so that the PCSs can ping the switch and the switch to the PCs.  So can you do it? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your challenge and get these networks working. Download the packet tracer file and see if you can get it working.  In the next video I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you to configure this network for those instructions.\"",

It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really important to have your documentation right. \\\\n\\\\nUnder this side, notice that neighbour relationship has come up as well.  \\\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advertise the loopback address. Notice I should specify the mask and I can also advertise 17.1.1.0 with the mask, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to advertise on both sides but you can do that.  \\\\n\\\\nSo   show ip bgp   we are seeing routes in the routing table, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 8, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15 and then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 17. \\\\n\\\\nAgain you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to advertise on both sides but you can do that in case one of the routers goes down or an interface goes down in your network. If multiple routers advertise you have redundancy. So notice this network and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll expand the console window.  \\\\n\\\\nThis network originated into this autonomous system then it went through this autonomous system then through this autonomous system and then the local autonomous system received the route.  The route is valid next hop is this router, so we should be able to ping the loopback of Router 1 which we can. We should able to trace the loopback of Router 1 which we can. Traffic went to Router 3, Router 2 and then Router 1.  \\\\n\\\\nIn the same way sh ip bgp on Router 1 shows us the loopback of Router 4.  The network originated in this autonomous system, went through this autonomous system and then this autonomous system and was then received by the local autonomous system.  \\\\n\\\\nThe route was advertised by Router 2, so can Router1 ping the loopback of Router 4? Yes it can.  Can we trace the loopback of Router 4? Yes we can. \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve successfully configured this network with BGP.  How did you do? Were you able to configure the network and get it working, make sure that you can before you go for your CCNA exam.  \\\\n\\\\nThe next video is a troubleshooting video. Make sure that you can troubleshoot BGP before taking your exam.\"",

You can see a list of assigned IPv4 addresses on Wikipedia.  This address block 8.8.8.0 belongs to level 3, 15 belongs to HPE, and 17 belongs to Apple. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use those address blocks in our network to simulate a BGP network running on the Internet.  \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve configured the topology with basic IP addressing, so what we need to do here is configure BGP.  \\\\nsh ip int brief shows us that this address is configured on gigabit 0/0/0 on Router 1 and this loopback address is configured on Router 1\\xe2\\x80\\xa6..\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/aXVKbf\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCan Router 1 ping Router 2?  Yes it can. So we have IP connectivity between Router 1 and Router 2.  Router 2 also has a loopback address configured of 2.2.2.2 and IP address is configured on the Ethernet interfaces.  \\\\n\\\\nThe same is true for Router 3 loopback address of 3.3.3.3 with IP addresses on Ethernet interfaces, and lastly the same thing is configured on Router 4.  Router 4 has a loopback address configured as well as an IP address on the gigabit interface, so let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configure a BGP.  \\\\n\\\\nIn global configuration mode router BGP, we need to specify an autonomous system number.  In our example it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 65,001 now unlike IGP such as EIGRP and OSPF, we have to manually configure and neighbour relationships in BGP.  \\\\n\\\\nIn BGP we use this concept just because I want to be your neighbour and it doesn\\'t mean that you want to be my neighbour, so both sides need to be configured statically with the IP address of the neighbour to form neighbour relationships with.  \\\\n\\\\nWe then need to specify the remote autonomous system, which in this example is 65,002. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how you can configure neighbour relationships in BGP.  We can then advertise networks, so network and specify network.  \\\\n\\\\nNow this is really important, you need to specify a mask, this is not an inverse mask, this is a mask based on the route in the routing table.  So sh ip route    shows us that we have a /32 network directly connected, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the IP address configured on loopback 0.  \\\\n\\\\nSo sh run    shows us that this IP address is configured on the loopback and it appears in the routing table as follows.  That means that when we configure BGP, we must configure BGP with the correct IP address and mask in exactly the same way as it appears in the routing table /32 mask.\\\\n\\\\nSo we use a /32 mask here.  So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advertise 8.8.8.0 with the mask for that network. Notice it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an inverse mask, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a standard mask.  Again, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s based on this information as shown in the routing table. \\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how you configure basic BGP. You specify your autonomous system number, you specify your neighbour with their autonomous system number and then you advertise routes into the BGP routing table.\"",

You will need to learn BGP for your CCNA exam. \\\\n\\\\nOn the exam topics, we can do search for BGP and in the list of topics we have configure and verify single-homed branch connectivity using eBGP IPv4.  This is limited to peering and route advertisement using the network command only.  \\\\n\\\\nBGP is an exterior gateway protocol or EGP, that is different to protocols such as EIGRP or OSPF which are IGPs also called Internal Gateway Protocols.  Exterior gateway protocols such as BGP are used between autonomous systems whereas IGP are used within autonomous systems.  BGP is used on the internet.\\\\n\\\\nThere are two versions of BGP: EBGP and IBGP.  EBGP is the focus of the CCNA course, EBGP runs between autonomous systems and IBGP can be used within an autonomous system.  In a similar way to OSPF or EIGRP, BGP is a very large topic and you can spend many hours and many days studying BGP.  \\\\n\\\\nBGP however for the CCNA is limited to this use case. In other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a basic introduction to BGP but you need to learn the basics of BGP and there are few things that you need to be aware of which can trip you up or cause problems in the exam.  So make sure that you can both configure and do some troubleshooting with BGP.\"",

This is one of a series of videos showing you how to get started using GNS3 on Windows.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos showing you how to download, install and configure GNS3 version 2.1 on a Windows 10 PC. \\\\n\\\\nWhen you first start out with GNS3 it can be quite confusing and even overwhelming to know what to do because there are many components and technologies that you can leverage within GNS3.  \\\\n\\\\nIn brief, there are two main components that you need to be aware of. The first component is the GNS3 GUI or GNS3 Graphical User Interface. This is a Windows executable that you install on your Windows computer. \\\\n\\\\nThe second main component is the GNS3 VM or GNS3 Virtual Machine.  This is a Virtual Machine that you run within a hypervisor such as a VirtualBox VMware Workstation or VMware Player.\\\\n\\\\nIn some cases, you don\\'t have to use the GNS3 VM. You only need the GNS3 Graphical User Interface. But for most implementations and for the best use of GNS3, it\\'s recommended that you use both the GNS3 GUI as well as the GNS3 VM.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition,you\\'re going to need the operating systems of devices. \\\\n\\\\nSo in other words, if you want to run a Cisco IOS  router, you need the Cisco IOS software.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re going to run an Arista switch, you need the Arista operating system or if you want to run a Juniper firewall, you\\'ll need the Juniper operating system. So whenever you want  to add networking vendors device to your GNS3 topologies,  you\\'ll need to provide the operating system for that device and you\\'ll need to download the operating system from the vendor\\'s\\\\nwebsite or as an example, copy it from a physical router or switch. \\\\n\\\\nAnd neither I and nor GNS3 can legally provide you with a Cisco IOS images. You have to provide your own images. that is a requirement for using GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nI would love to give you IOS images but neither I or GNS3, due to legal requirements, are able to provide IOS images to you, you need to provide your own. \\\\n\\\\nIn these series of videos I\\'m going to show you firstly, how to install the GNS3 GUI and get a basic network working using the GNS3 GUI. And then in subsequent videos I\\'ll show you how to download and integrate the GNS3 VM with the GNS3 GUI and how to run devices such as  Cisco VIRL IOSv and IOSv Layer 2 on the GNS VM.\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

This course is not like other CCNA courses.  This course is practical, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands-on and it allows you to practically verify your knowledge of CCNA topics.  \\\\n\\\\nBefore we get started, let  me ask you a question: Are you ready to take and pass your CCNA exam?  Are you sure that you are prepared for the exam?  \\\\n\\\\nWell, this course can give you both the confidence and the knowledge to pass the CCNA exam.  In my experience I found that a lot of CCNA courses are very  theoretical.  They teach you theory but they miss the practical component of hands-on labs.  The best way that you can learn Cisco CCNA technologies is to simply do it.  Configure devices, troubleshoot devices and spend time configuring networks\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6..  \\\\n\\\\nPractical hands-on labs are simply the best way to learn networking and specifically Cisco technologies in preparation for the CCNA exam.  \\\\n\\\\nThis course will as quickly as possible get you configuring Cisco networks.  There are many network topologies in this course that allow you to verify your knowledge of networking technologies such as BGP, OSPF, EIGRP, Spanning  Tree, VLANs, HSRP and many other technologies that you need to know for the CCNA exam.  \\\\n\\\\nWhen you were a child, you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t learn to ride a bicycle by reading a book.  You learned to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle, you may have fallen off a few times but through practice, you become proficient at riding a bicycle.  In the same way in this course, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re presented with multiple practical labs that you need to complete.  \\\\n\\\\nThis is hands-on training you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be presented with a lab scenario which you can either complete yourself or you can watch me complete the lab and learn various tips and tricks along the way.  \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not simply going to complete the lab, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to explain things as I completed.  This is a comprehensive course that ensures that you are ready to take the CCNA exam, make sure that you are prepared for the lab portion of the CCNA exam by  taking this course.   \\\\n\\\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99m David Bombal and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been training Cisco courses for over 15 years.  I passed my Cisco CCIE certification exam in 2003.  \\\\n\\\\nThe future is here, are you going to grab it and get a certified as a Cisco Certified Network Associate?  You can change your future just like I did when I got my CCNA certification , the CCNA is your first step into the world of networking and a bright future working with Cisco devices and networking technologies.  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe world runs on networks. Without networks and network engineers to configure, manage and optimize networks, we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Google,  we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Facebook,  we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have internet banking, we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have smartphones or any of the other devices and technologies that we take for granted in a modern connected world.  We are connected by networks and people like you and I need to manage, troubleshoots and optimize networks to ensure that the world can connect and communicate.  \\\\n\\\\nSo what are you going to do about it?  Are you ready to take the next step?  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ready, what about you? Are you ready to take the next step in ensuring that you are prepared for the CCNA exam?

For much more, go to http://www.cciepython.com \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLearn how to automate your networks using Python.\\\\n\\\\nI want to welcome you to this Python for networking course.  This course is not like other Python courses.  In my experience I found that a lot of Python courses are trying to make networking engineers Python developers.  They concentrate very heavily on Python theory and they spend a lot of time teaching you the ins and outs of Python instead of getting you to use Python to configure network devices as quickly as possible. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do in this course.  \\\\n\\\\nThis course consists of multiple portions and leverages GNS3 to create multiple network topologies that you can configure and automate through Python.\\\\n \\\\nIn the next video I am going to show you how you can very quickly start configuring network devices using Python.\\\\n \\\\nOne of the biggest stumbling blocks when learning network automation is the barrier or huge mountain that Network Engineers think they have to climb before they can configure network devices.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not true.  Within 20 minutes in the next video, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you how you can configure OSPF and loopback interfaces on a Cisco IOSv router.  \\\\n\\\\nThe video after that will show you how to configure VLANs and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll learn how to configure Cisco network devices using telnet as well as SSH.\\\\n \\\\nIn the upcoming videos, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use multiple modules and leverage the work done by others. \\\\n\\\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reinvent the wheel, leverage the hard work that others have done and made freely available through Python. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use tools such as the telnet library, Paramiko, Netmiko, NAPALM and other s to automate the configuration of the multiple networks.\\\\n \\\\nAgain, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leveraging GNS3, in most of these videos you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to use GNS3.  You could use real world physical equipment if you wanted to. \\\\n\\\\nThe advantage however of GNS3 is that, you can build virtual networks very quickly on your laptop.  You can learn Python and configure Python networks wherever you are.  You just need your laptop and GNS3 running on your laptop.\\\\n \\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a safe place to be. Your GNS3 network is not your live network. So you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t inadvertently break a production network by running a Python script on your GNS3 network.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a safe place to learn.\\\\n\\\\nOnce I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shown you how to quickly configure networks using Python, there is a theory section.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take you from the basics of Python to more complex topics.\\\\n \\\\nSo if you want to take your Python knowledge further, and learn the ins and outs of Python, the Theory Section will give you that knowledge. And then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a section providing more complex topologies, more complex scripts and scripts using a software developer approach to writing code. \\\\n\\\\nAs a saying goes, Rome wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t built in a day; Babies don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run marathons. And in the same way, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try and  conquer the world of Python in one day.  \\\\n\\\\nLearn the basics, make mistakes, try again and constantly increase your knowledge.\\\\n \\\\nSo again, welcome to my Python course!  Please provide feedback. Based on the feedback and suggestions I receive, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add more content or just the content.\\\\n \\\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always posting new content to my YouTube channel.  So if you got suggestions of content to add to this course, or just other general content that you would like to see, let me know and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll either add it to this course or add it to my YouTube channel.\\\\n\\\\n I want to wish you all the very best in your journeys in Network Programmability and Network Automation. \\\\n \\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the future and the future is here for you to grab it and change your future to improve your job prospects and ensure that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become a relic of the   common line interface.  The world is changing and we need to keep on learning to improve our skill set and take hold of bigger opportunities in the industry.\\\\n \\\\nWith that said, I want to wish you all the very best in your journeys with Python, Network Programmability and Network Automation.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. Cisco Wired LAN Design Guide: https://goo.gl/k855Vj\\\\n\\\\nScript on Github: https://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/8aa5917f132c3d8956fee9337f24b30067b0413d\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of the multiple videos showing you how to use Python to configure Cisco networks.\\\\n In this example, we\\'re going to use Netmiko to configure a campus network running in GNS3 based on a validated Cisco technology design guide for campus wired local area networks. \\\\n\\\\nOk so the first thing we need to do is copy our script and this is the script that is using the Cisco design guide. So I\\'ll create a file called Netmiko Cisco design and I\\'ll paste the script into that file. \\\\n\\\\nSo here\\'s our Netmiko file. We are connecting to each switch in the topology once again.  We are opening up a file called IOSv L2 Cisco design. We are going to apply that to the access switches and then we\\'ll open up a core file and apply that to the core switches. We\\'ve actually already applied the configuration to the core switches. So the important file that we need to create now is our access layer switch source files\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\\\n\\\\nSo here\\'s the configuration that we want to apply on our access switches. So I\\'ll paste that configuration in. So as you can see it\\'s quite a large configuration. \\\\nI\\'ll exit and save the file so the following we need to run is the Cisco design file. So Python Netmiko Cisco design. Now again one of the great reasons for using GNS3 is you can test your scripts and make sure that they work properly before you try and deploy this in a production environment. \\\\n\\\\nSo there\\'s the configuration that we\\'re going to apply to the access layer switches. So at the moment, on Switch 5, notice we\\'ve got a lot of configuration added to the switch. I\\'ll just do something you don\\'t really want to do in production and that is a stop the script and the reason why is I want to show you what the current configuration looks like on a switch like Switch 4.\\\\n\\\\nSo notice we have some basic configuration. There is no certificate, we have some trunk port configuration on the access port ports belong to VLAN 2 but that\\'s the only configuration on gigabit 2/0 and notice is not much else configuration. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s run that script again. It\\'s connected to Switch 5, so ready on Switch 5. You can see that a certificate exists. Notice all the error disabled options have been added. There\\'s our voice VLAN and our data VLAN trunk ports look the same. What we should see is some configuration done on the access ports. \\\\n\\\\nSo it tells us now that this is the configuration that was done on Switch 5. You can see it\\'s a large configuration that was done. So going through the config again, notice we seeing a lot of DHCP snooping configuration of inspection certificates have been added. There\\'s our error disabled Recovery Options. Here are our VLANs and if we scroll down to the access port. Notice the difference on gigabit 2/0. A large configuration has been applied and the same is true on gigabit 2/1, as well as 2/2, as well as 2/3, a lot of config was added to those access ports.\\\\n\\\\nNow on Switch 4 we can see that the configuration was changed. There is a new certificate clocks were updated. So show run, now on Switch 4 again we see VTP transparent mode, UDLD ARP inspection, DNS information, DHCP snooping. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s the certificate that was added, error disabled was added, Spanning Tree and VLANs were added and on the access ports once again we can see a large configuration was added. \\\\n\\\\nSo the script has now finished configuring the entire network.\\\\nLet\\'s have a look at Switch 3 the third access switch sh int status \\\\n\\\\nNotice that gigabit 2/0 is in VLAN 100\\\\nsh interface gigabit 2/0 switch port  you can see the access of VLAN and voice VLAN configured on that port. \\\\nsh run interface gigabit 2/0 there\\'s the configuration of the data VLAN and voice VLAN. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s port security, ARP inspection, Spanning Tree, IP version 6, neighbor discovery, DHCP snooping,  here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s port 2/1 same configuration, 2/2 same configuration. \\\\nSo we\\'ve applied at the same access port configuration consistently on multiple access ports on multiple switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo that was an example of how to apply a fairly complex configuration to multiple network devices. Rather than manually trying to configure the switches with this configuration, we\\'ve used Python to SSH to 3 access switches and apply the configuration to those switches. \\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

This guide can help you implement best practices in Wired campus networks.\\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, at the access layer, you need to think about a security and implementing DHCP snooping, IP source guard, port security, and dynamic ARP inspection. \\\\nDifferent access layer platforms are discussed and lots of examples and best practices and associated explanations are provided in this guide. There are examples of how to implement quality of service for IP phones.\\\\n\\\\nSo very good examples of quality of service are provided in this guide. There\\'s also a procedure for LAN switch universal settings such as configuring the host name, such as configuring VTP transparent mode and the reasons for configuring VTP transparent mode. \\\\nIt\\'s recommended that you run rapid PVST, you enable UDLD, you enable recovery mechanisms to allow ports disabled as a result of errors to automatically clear error disabled status and attempt a recovery. \\\\n\\\\nSo we have this option error disabled recovery cause all for EtherChannels you should be using load balancing using source and destination IP addresses. You should configure a DNS server. You should configure HTTPS and disable HTTP. You should be using SSH rather than telnet. You can enable SNMP and then lock it down SNMP using an access list as well as locking down access to the vty lines. \\\\n\\\\nYou can configure a local username and password or better use a TACACS server. You should also be using NTP and set your time stamps.\\\\n\\\\nSo there\\'s a lot of good information in this guide. I won\\'t bore you going through the entire guide. They talk about the VLAN configuration, setting a IP default gateway or IP route enabling DHCP snooping, enabling ARP inspection, configuring BPDU guard on port fast enabled interfaces, enabling IPv6 first top security policy for host ports, configuring voice VLANs and access VLANs optimizing the interface for device connectivity by applying the switch port host command \\\\n\\\\nThis command does 3 things: it applies search port access mode which disables the negotiation of trunking and enables participation as an access port in a VLAN, it enables PortFast it then continues talking about port security. \\\\n\\\\nSo basically there\\'s a lot of configuration that you should be applying to an access switch. So on an access switch connected to a distribution switch, you\\'re going to want to configure a data VLAN, a voice VLAN, in management VLAN configure a default gateway, configure IP DHCP snooping, configure ARP inspection, Spanning Tree PortFast.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s a range of commands that you\\'re going to want to configure on your access interfaces and you\\'re going to want to configure quality of service. \\\\n\\\\nSo here\\'s an example of some of the commands that you should configure on your devices in your network. I\\'ve just taken some sample data.\\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, I\\'ve got an SNMP community that\\'s read-only called Python1. \\\\nSNMP community called Python2 which is read-write. I\\'ve configured an NTP server and some other options that notice there\\'s quite a bit of configuration to do on your devices in your network.\\\\nIn this example I\\'ve only got 3 access switches but imagine that you had many access switches in your topology and that you wanted to ensure that the configuration was consistent on all your devices.\\\\n\\\\nThis is where an automation tool such as Python or Ansible can be very useful. \\\\nSo in our example I\\'m going to use a simple Python script to configure these searches in the topology based on this campus-wide design document as well as a call configuration which we saw in the previous video. \\\\n\\\\nSo my access switches are going to be configured using a file called iosv_l2_cisco and let\\'s call it Cisco design.\\\\n\\\\nSo we\\'ll create a file with these commands from the Cisco design guide and these commands will then be applied to the 3 access switches in our topology. Switch 5, 4 and 3. In other words these 3 access switches.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python.\\\\n\\\\nScript on GitHub:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/d6abbecb6702426cff9635ffe41fcfd2e7a5fb7d\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of the multiple videos showing you how to use Netmiko to configure a GNS3 topology. \\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re applying the same configuration on all the switches and you might not want to do that. You might want to apply some code on some switches and different code on other switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, your access switches may require different configuration to your core switches.\\\\nSo what we could do is create a file for access switches and then create a file for call switches and what we could do is configure our access switches per the configuration in the access file and then configure the core switches with the configuration in the core file. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s copy that. I\\'ll go back to GNS3. Let\\'s create a new file called netmiko4 and paste the script in. Again it\\'s not optimized fully but we\\'ll get the job done\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\\\n\\\\nNow we\\'re gonna copy iosv config to iosv access and call and then we\\'ll edit iosv_l2 access and what we could do as an example is say only these ports will be configured on the access switches. \\\\nSo gigabit 0/0 - 1 will be configured as trunks. Other ports will configured as access ports and then on the core switches we could remove the access port configuration and only configure the relevant ports with the right configuration. \\\\n\\\\nSo now we can use the command python netmiko4 to configure, firstly the access switches and secondly the core switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo as you can see, Switch 5 is only configured on the relevant ports so is Switch 4. So is Switch 3 and now we have a different set of configuration for the core switches. Switch 2 is configured only with trunk ports and Switch 1 is only configured with trunk ports.\\\\n\\\\nNow I must warn you using an in-band management network can cause problems when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making configuration changes like the configuration changes in our script. You may have issues with Spanning Tree 3 re-computing. You may have issues where changes that you make through the script can block IP connectivity to your devices and thus it makes more sense to have an out-of-band management network wherever possible or if you only have an in-band management network, be careful with Spanning Tree. Be careful with the changes that you are making because it could affect the script having SSH or telnet access to your switches. \\\\n\\\\nIf the Ubuntu device can\\'t SSH to the devices for whatever reason, you could end up with a half configured network. Be careful with in-band management.\\\\n\\\\nNow, you may want to optimize Spanning Tree and other options in this network show spanning tree, shows us that we have shared links between the switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example on gigabit 0/1 we might want to use the command spanning- tree link- type point-to-point to improve the way that Spanning Tree works that however should be configured on all devices in the network to improve Spanning Tree convergence. \\\\n\\\\nAgain be careful with in=band management. So what I could do is say nano iosv_l2 access and what I\\'ll do is paste that command under the trunk ports so that the trunk ports get configured as point to point Spanning Tree links which will improve convergence. \\\\n\\\\nOn Switch 5 as an example shows spanning-tree notice all ports are shared ports we can see the root and alternate port but the ports are shared ports. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s run python netmiko4 there the commands that are going to be applied. You can see as an example that Spanning Tree link type point-to-point will be used at the moment we still seeing the ports are shared ports configuration has been done. Notice the change point-to-point. \\\\n\\\\nSo show run interface gigabit 0/0. Notice Spanning Tree point-to-point has been added to both the up links on the switch.\\\\n\\\\nBut as an example, if we look at port 2/0 that is still configured as an access port the script is now configuring the core switches. \\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\n================================\\\\nScript on GitHub:\\\\n================================\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/8a39cd4b16afc8f34564b1201d0d37800dd50c81\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. \\\\nThis is one of the multiple videos showing you how to use Netmiko to configure a GNS3 topology. \\\\n\\\\nIn this topology, we have 5 Cisco IOSv switches; Switch 1, Switch 2, 3, 4 and 5. Switch 1 and 2 are acting as core switches in this topology and switches  3, 4, and 5 are acting as access switches. I\\'ve got an Ubuntu docker container with Python installed as well as Netmiko.\\\\n\\\\nWe will use a Python script to configure this port, this port and of this port as access ports in this campus topology and all the links between the switches will be configured as trunk ports. \\\\nSwitch 1 and Switch 2 have been configured a spanning tree root and backup root but essentially, all that\\'s been configured on these switches is IP addresses and SSH to allow the Python script to SSH to the switches and configure them. \\\\n\\\\nSo essentially the switches have been configured with an IP address and SSH to allow the Python client to SSH to them and configure them.\\\\n\\\\nThe Python script that  we are going to use is fairly simple. We\\'re using Netmiko, so we\\'ve got to the statement from Netmiko import connect handler. We are then specifying the details of the switches in the topology. Switch 1 has this IP address, Switch 2 has this IP address, Switch 3, Switch 4 and Switch 5. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve named the devices iosv_l2_s1, here\\'s s2, s3, s4 and s5. Now we could optimize the code more than we have here.\\\\n\\\\nBut notice there\\'s only a few lines to configure the switches. I\\'m using a with statement to open a file called iosv_l2_ config that file will have these commands in it. \\\\n\\\\nEssentially, what we\\'re going to do in the topology is create a VLAN 2 and configure interfaces gigabit  2/0 - 3 as access ports in VLAN 2. \\\\n\\\\nAt the moment only gigabit 2/0 is connected to a PC. But let\\'s assume that there are additional interfaces that need to be configured in VLAN 2, \\\\n\\\\nSo these are the access ports on the switch. Other interfaces, so gigabit 0/0 - 3 will be configured as trunk ports. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explicitly configure the encapsulation as dot1q set the mode to trunk. Turn off DTP and allow VLANs 1 and 2. \\\\n\\\\nIn addition, we could configure gigabit 1/0 and 1/1. So we could do something like this and do the same configuration. \\\\n\\\\nSo essentially this config file has the configuration that we want to apply on the switches. \\\\nPython is going to open that file and each line will be read and split into a list. That list is going to be called Netmiko over here. \\\\n\\\\nSo for all the devices in our network as specified here, we\\'re going to connect to the device and then we\\'re going to send configuration commands to the switches as specified by the list. This print statement will show us the commands that will be applied to the switches. \\\\n\\\\nOkay, so what I\\'ll do is copy the script to the Ubuntu hosts. Let\\'s create a file called netmiko3 and I\\'ll paste that script into the file.\\\\n\\\\nSo there\\'s the file I\\'ll exit nano and save the file so cat netmiko3 shows us the script that we\\'ve created. \\\\n\\\\nNow that script is calling a file called iosv_ l2 config\\\\nSo let\\'s create a file with that name. These are the commands that we\\'re going to configure on the switches. So I\\'ll paste the commands into nano and then exit and save the file. So cat iosv_ l2 config That\\'s the configuration that we\\'re going to do on the devices.\\\\ncat netmiko3 shows us our script. \\\\n\\\\nNow I\\'m going to be configuring the devices in reverse order. So Switch 5, then Switch 4, then Switch 3, then Switch 2 and then Switch 1.  \\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s because we\\'re using an in-band management network. \\\\nThe problem with doing configuration changes like this using an  in-band management network, is you could lock yourself out of your devices. So we may have a problem where the Ubuntu device \\\\ncan\\'t connect to say Switch 5 when we make changes on the trunk ports.\\\\n\\\\nSo that\\'s why as discussed previously, you may want to use an out-of-band management network. \\\\nSo let\\'s run the script python netmiko3  Those are the commands that are going to be applied to the switches. \\\\n\\\\nYou can see that configuration has been done to Switch 5 and then to Switch 4, now to Switch 3, Switch 2 and Switch 1....\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

So I\\'ve got three switches booted and configured for SSH in GNS3 and I can now configure them through Netmiko. Netmiko makes it easy. This is the configuration for switch 1 here\\'s the configuration for switch 2\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s the configuration for switch 3. If I have additional switches I would simply configure those additional switches in the Python script and now what I can do is create a variable that contains IOS v layer 2 switch 1 switch 2 and switch 3 and then I can run a loop. So I can say four devices in all devices, in other words these three switches we\\'re going to connect to those devices and then I\\'m going to run a sub loop where I create 20 VLANs on each of those switches. So it\\'s quite a simple script which I\\'ll now copy. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s my Ubuntu host I\\'ve got a script called a Netmiko1. So let\\'s create another one called Netmiko 2 and I\\'ll paste that script in. \\\\n\\\\nThe script is once again available on github and I\\'ve referenced it below this video. So there\\'s the script. Now before I run the script I\\'ll reduce the number of VLANs to 5 so that you don\\'t have to watch me wait for the VLANs to run. \\\\n\\\\nSo now python netmiko2 before I run the script, let\\'s have a look at the VLANs on Switch 2 as an example.\\\\n\\\\nshow vlan brief switch 2 only has the default VLANs configured \\\\nswitch 3 sh vlan brief only has the default VLANs configured switch 1 was previously configured. \\\\n\\\\nSo it has more VLANs, so sh vlan brief notice it has 30 VLANs configured but what we should notice is when the script SSH is into the switches that it will configure VLANs on switch 1 which is currently doing and then it will connect to switch 2 and switch 3 and configure the 5 VLANs.\\\\nSo it\\'s now configured the VLANs on switch 1. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that it\\'s creating VLAN to which will be on switch 2. We can see that it\\'s connected to switch 2, so sh vlan brief, we can see that 4 VLANs have been configured on switch 2 and now 5  VLANs have been configured. \\\\n\\\\nsh vlan brief  there was a problem accessing switch 3. Notice there\\'s a trace back saying that there\\'s a problem on switch 3. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s look at the code and make sure that everything looks good so that all looks the same. Can we ping 192.168.122.73  yes we can but perhaps SSH hasn\\'t been enabled properly on this switch. \\\\nSo let\\'s 192.168.122.73 notice the connection is refused. So let\\'s ensure that the keys are created. \\\\n\\\\nSo crypto key generate RSA. \\\\nLet\\'s try and SSH again. Notice we are asked whether we want to login and we can access the switch. So let\\'s run the script again and make sure that the VLANs are configured on the 3 switches. So it\\'s currently configuring switch 1, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll speed the video up so said that you don\\'t have to watch it cycle through the VLANs again. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s configuring switch 2 at the moment and now its configuring switch 3. \\\\nSo show vlan brief you can see 4 VLANs configured 5 VLANs have been configured. \\\\nSo the script has successfully configured 5 VLANs on the three switches. So it was as simple as that to configure 3 switches with the VLANs using a very basic Python script. \\\\n\\\\nNow again these scripts can be optimized but at this point I simply want you to see that it\\'s \\\\npossible for you to configure network devices using Python. It may sound really complicated and very difficult but actually it\\'s not.\\\\n\\\\nI hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, please like it and please subscribe to my YouTube channel. I wish you all the very best!\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\n================================\\\\nScript on GitHub:\\\\n================================\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/90f349178c9dba5d65a1304c97814505d59be5bb\\\\n================================\\\\nInstall Netmiko:\\\\n================================\\\\napt-get update\\\\napt-get install python -y\\\\napt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev -y\\\\napt-get install python-pip -y\\\\npip install cryptography\\\\npip install netmiko\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n================================\\\\nAl\\'s GNS3 community entry:\\\\n================================\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video I showed you how to use Paramiko to configure a switch using SSH. Paramiko is a Python implementation of the SSH of version 2 protocol and provides both client and server functionality. \\\\n\\\\nNow Netmiko is a multi-vendor library that was developed to simplify Paramiko SSH connections to network devices. This is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. You can find out more details about the software on github.\\\\n\\\\nBut in brief, it\\'s once again a multi vendor library that allows you to connect to network devices using SSH. It supports Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5. \\\\n\\\\nIt supports a wide range of devices, devices that are tested on a regular basis include Aresta vEOS, Cisco ASA, Cisco IOS,  IOS XE. IOS XR, Nexus OS, the Cisco SG300, HP Comware and Aruba or ProCurve software Juniper and Linux. There\\'s been limited testing on devices from Avaya, Brocade, Dell and other vendors.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s also experimental testing with yet more devices. The idea once again is to simplify SSH connections in multi vendor environments. \\\\n\\\\nNow multiple devices are supported and you can find the list by clicking on this link. As you can see, there\\'s a wide range of devices that are supported using SSH. Now the way you get started is you use from Netmiko import connect handler then you specify a name for your device and you specify the device type. In this example I\\'m going to be using Cisco IOS.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a list of device types, we have Cisco IOS, Cisco XE, Cisco ASA, Nexus and a long list of devices are listed here but  we\\'re going to start off with Cisco IOS. \\\\n\\\\nYou then specify the IP address, username and password to connect to the device. You can specify a port number, default is port 22. You can specify a secret default it is not used, verbose is turned off. \\\\n\\\\nYou then connect to the device and you can execute commands such as show commands using the net connect send command option. For long-running commands you can use the send command expect which waits for the trailing prompt or for an optional pattern.\\\\n\\\\nSo as an example,  you could use this for write memory you can enter and exit enable mode. You can change options such as the config of devices. Netmiko will automatically enter configuration mode to make those changes when you specify send config.\\\\n\\\\n I\\'m going to demonstrate this it\\'s always using GNS3 and here\\'s an example of the code that I\\'m going to run on an IOSv switch in the GNS3 network.\\\\n\\\\nSo here\\'s my Ubuntu client and my IOSvL 2 switch. This is the same topology as I used for the previous video. \\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video, I showed you the steps to install Paramiko.  The steps are very much the same. I\\'ve put them below this video. The one difference is we\\'re going to use pip install Netmiko to install Netmiko. I\\'ve already done that. In this example, if you\\'re installing this on a new device here are the steps and I\\'ve linked them below so either install Paramiko or Netmiko or both. \\\\n\\\\nSo in my example I\\'ve got Netmiko installed on the Ubuntu client and I\\'ve got SSH pre-configured on the switch.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to see how I set that up, please have a look at the previous video where I discuss Paramiko. \\\\n\\\\nOk so here are the steps from Netmiko import connect handler we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re specifying a device called IOSv Layer 2 to the device. Type is Cisco IOS. This is the IP address of the switch. Here\\'s the username and the password to login to the switch. \\\\n\\\\nYou can support multiple devices by creating codes such as the following. I\\'ll show you that later. We are then going to connect to the IOSv Layer 2 switch and I\\'m going to send a command sh ip interface brief and print that output.\\\\n\\\\nThis shows you an example of a privilege or enable command on a Cisco device,  I\\'m then going to send configuration commands. In this example we\\'ll create a loopback. Loopback 0 and configure this IP address on the loopback 0 interface...\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

So thanks Al for sharing.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m going to demonstrate how to install Paramiko using the steps that Al has shared on the GNS3 community.\\\\n\\\\nIn this topology I\\'ve got an Ubuntu docker container which I\\'ve configured to use DHCP. That\\'s now booted and got an IP address from the NAT cloud. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example the Ubuntu client can ping google.com. The Cisco switch in this topology has just booted but has no configuration on it. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ll demonstrate in a moment how to configure SSH on the switch and then we\\'ll configure the Ubuntu client to use Paramiko and SSH to configure the switch. The module that I\\'m going to use for SSH is Paramiko.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a Python implementation of the SSH version 2 protocol which provides both client and server functionality. You can find out more information about Paramiko on paramiko.org or docs.paramiko.org. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve written a script which I\\'ve linked below on github that imports Paramiko and uses SSH to connect to the Cisco switch and configure some options on the switch. We\\'ll configure some loopback interfaces and then we\\'ll run a loop to configure VLANs on the switch.\\\\nSo I\\'m hoping that this video and script help you configure network devices using SSH rather than just relying on telnet. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example I\\'m using sublime text which is a great text editor. You can find out more about sublime text on their website sublimetext.com. Unfortunately no one pays me money to recommend these products. This is just stuff that I\\'ve found useful and you may be interested in knowing about as well. \\\\n\\\\nOk so the first thing we need to do is install Paramiko and Python on this Ubuntu client. This Ubuntu client has just booted up, doesn\\'t have any configuration apart from an IP address.\\\\nSo what I\\'ll simply do here is follow the list of commands that Al has put on the GNS3 community and I\\'ll reference the links below. \\\\n\\\\nSo install Python, install some additional software, install pip. I\\'ll use pip to install cryptography and then we\\'ll use pip to install Paramiko. You simply need to wait for the processes to complete. So install Paramiko here as well and I\\'ll upgrade pip while I\\'m here. \\\\nSo once again, Paramiko is now installed on this Ubuntu server. \\\\n\\\\nSo follow these steps if you want to install Paramiko on your Ubuntu client. So that\\'s the Ubuntu device configured. We now need to configure the switch for SSH. So to set up a SSH on the switch the first thing we need to do is configure a hostname which we\\'ve done already. Then we\\'re going to specify a domain name which in this case I\\'m going to call CCIE Python.com. Then we\\'re going to generate some keys so cryptic key generate RSA. I\\'ll use 1024 as the number of bits.\\\\n\\\\nSo that\\'s been done. I\\'ll specify an enable password of cisco and in this example I\\'ll configure a username of david password of cisco and give david level 15 privileges on the vty lines.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll use the login local command and transport input all. So SSH is now configured on the switch. what we can do now is have a look at our python script. So we\\'re going to import Paramiko, we\\'re also going to import a time you may want to add some delays in your script and that\\'s what sleep allows you to do. So I\\'m sleeping one second before I\\'m outputting the session when I\\'m creating the VLANs on the switch.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\nScript on GitHub:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/blob/master/pythonR1script1.py\\\\n\\\\nPython Video 1: https://youtu.be/IhroIrV9_7w\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nGNS3 now supports Jupyter. In this video, I\\'m going to show you how to import the GNS3 appliances from the GNS3 marketplace for both Python  3 as well as Python 2.7. \\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. Jupyter makes it very easy for you to develop code and share code and not only supports Python but also supports other languages such as R and Scala. \\\\n\\\\nIt allows you to share notebooks with others and is currently used by many companies and universities around the world. So to get started, go to the GNS3 website, click on Marketplace, Appliances and search for Jupyter. The Jupyter appliance supports Python 3.0, whereas the Jupyter 2.7 appliance supports Python 2.7.  I\\'ve downloaded both to my local hard drive.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m going to integrate both with GNS3 and I\\'ll demonstrate using the Jupyter to configure a Cisco IOS V router using Python. \\\\n\\\\nPlease note that in this video, I\\'m using GNS3 2.0 release candidates 3. I\\'m also using the GNS3 VM as recommended by GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nSo if these appliances don\\'t work in your release of GNS3, you may need to upgrade to GNS3 2.0 release candidate 3. To import the appliances, go to file, Import Appliance and select Jupyter, click Open, a brief overview of the appliance as shown. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that the Jupyter notebook is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.\\\\n\\\\nBasically we\\'re going to use the Jupyter appliance for running Python code. I\\'m going to click Next. It\\'s recommended that the appliance run on the GNS3 VM and that\\'s what I\\'m going to do. So I\\'m going to click Next. This appliance uses HTTP the port number used by Jupyter is 8888 but GNS3 will select a port number for this connection. I\\'m going to click Next. We\\'re told that the appliance will be available in the guest category. I\\'m going to click finish and we\\'re told that the Jupyter appliance is installed. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m now going to import the 2.7 appliance. The process is very similar so click Next run it on the GNS3 VM, click Next. It also uses HTTP. Console port is shown here, click Next. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that it\\'s also going to be available in the guest category, click Finish. So both of those appliances are now installed and notice what happens when I drag them to the workspace. As this is a docker container, the appliance is automatically downloaded and installed in GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nSo you simply need to wait for the docker pool to complete and the amount of time that this takes depends really on your internet speed. \\\\n\\\\nOkay, so GNS3 has successfully pulled the Jupyter image. I\\'ll drag version 2.7 to the workspace and what you\\'ll notice is, it also does a pull and downloads the image. Okay that image has also successfully been pulled so both my Jupyter devices are now available. Now before I connect these Jupyter containers to any device, notice I can boot them up and connect to the console using HTTP. Our web browser is launched and connects to the device. it\\'s connecting via a port selected by GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nAnd what I can do here is example, you select a new python notebook and I can run a live code here. So notice it gives me help and I can create some simple code and then run it and that\\'s the code that\\'s now run. I can edit my code, create some more code. To actively run the code, there are a lot of options available through this interface and I\\'ll cover more about the interface in subsequent videos. For now, I simply want to get you started and we want to configure network device using Jupyter.\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, I\\'ll configure this Cisco router using Python 2.0. But this is a nice way to learn the differences between 2.0 and version 3 of Python. So in this example, what I\\'m going to do is power down the Jupyter 2.7 appliance. I\\'m going to right click and click Edit config and I\\'m simply going to remove the comments for the static interface configuration. The appliance will be configured with this IP address 192.168. 02  I\\'m going to click Save and start up the appliance. \\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\'ll do now is connect to the cisco router and here it is. I\\'ll bypass the initial configuration dialog and let\\'s configure GigabitEthernet0/1 with IP address 192.168.01,subnet mask of /24 and let\\'s see if we can ping the Jupyter 2.7 PC. And as you can see there, I\\'m able to do that.... \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDiscounted link to course here: https://goo.gl/ntqu3G\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\nIn this video I show you how to open a file and leverage that for configuring Cisco switches. I also demonstrate the importance of spacing in Python.\\\\n\\\\nCode is on GitHub here:\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/13574b46f5be90c3316a5a93c1addc5a63e043c8\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve had this question asked a number of times: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavid can you show us how to backup the conflicts of multiple switches using Python?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\\\n\\\\nSo in this video I\\'m going to show you a quick demonstration of how you can backup the configuration of multiple devices using Python. This is One of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. \\\\n\\\\nSo in this topology we have five switches, Switch 1, Switch 2, Switch 3, 4 and 5, which are Cisco IOSv Layer 2 switches. Previously, we created various scripts. One of the files is switchloopfile.py   So let\\'s have a look at that file\\\\n\\\\nThis script is going to open a file called myswitches and for each align in the file, it\\'s going to telnet to a switch and then it\\'s going to configure various VLANs.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s have a look at myswitches, that\\'s a list of IP addresses of switches in the network. What I\\'ll do now is copy switchloopfile.py to getconfigs.py. So nano getconfig.py  There\\'s some redundant codes. What I\\'ll do is remove imports. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s also add some comments to this code to improve it. So for this first piece of code we\\'ll ask for username and password. This will open a file called myswitches. \\\\n\\\\nNow per Python best practices, you can use either single quotes or double quotes but it\\'s a good idea to be consistent so let me fix that and make it consistent. So what happens here is we are asking the user to enter the username and password then we open a file called myswitches and for each align in the file which consists of an IP address, it\\'s going to print out some information. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s say get running config from switch and then it will print out the IP address of the switch. Then what it\\'s going to do is set host equal to the line in the file. Now I\\'m going to strip redundant information in the line of the file such as hidden spaces in the file. \\\\n\\\\nSo when you retrieve an IP address from a file, it\\'s a good idea to strip  any whitespace so that you only get the IP address of the device. Then we\\'re going to tell it to the device we\\'re going to enter a username which was previously requested over here so that variable stores the username and we are going to write the username to the switch right to the password to the switch and now rather than doing conft, what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do here is type terminal length 0. \\\\n\\\\nThe reason for doing that, is when you type show run on the switch by default, it only shows you a certain number of lines and you have to press spacebar multiple times to see the full configuration. But if you type terminal length 0 and then type show run it\\'s going to show you the full running config in one go and that\\'s what we want to do. \\\\n\\\\nWe don\\'t want to program the script to have to look for more and then press spacebar. We might as well just to show the entire output of the running config in one go. So I\\'ll copy that to another line.  Once we\\'ve typed terminal length, we can type shall run. We don\\'t need any of this extra configuration. So essentially, what we\\'re doing is typing terminal length 0 show run and we\\'ll exit out of the telnet session. \\\\n\\\\nNow we want to store that information somewhere, so what I\\'m going to do is create another variable called read output equal TN, TN is the variable we\\'re using for our telnet session. So notice over here TN equals telnet a library telnet host. Host being the IP address found in each line of our file.  So we\\'re going to read all the output and then we\\'re going to save that output to a file. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'m going to open up a file called switch + the hostname which is the IP address of the switch. I\\'m going to write to the file. Now previously when I said F equals open myswitches the default option here is read-only. So you could specify R here for read-only but I\\'m not going to bother with that the default is read-only.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\nIn this video I show you how to open a file and leverage that for configuring Cisco switches. I also demonstrate the importance of spacing in Python.\\\\n\\\\nCode is on GitHub here:\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/d3190711ffe338b7a89e1d6bedc82b5d21789e73\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. \\\\nSo let\\'s continue improving or iterating our Python script for network automation. \\\\nAt the moment our script looks as follows. \\\\n\\\\nWe are configuring multiple switches by using a loop. So we are saying for n in the range 72 to 77 configure switches with IP addresses 192.168.122.72  73 74 75 76 and 77. \\\\n\\\\nIn other words, these five Cisco switches will be configured in our topology. Now as many times in life there are other ways of doing things and perhaps better ways of doing things. \\\\nOne of the criticisms you may have of a solution like this, is what happens if your switches are not using IP addresses that are sequential. You may have switches and routers mixed in this range of IP addresses or you may only want to configure some Cisco switches and not others. \\\\nSo one of the things we can do is use a full loop and in addition we can read from a file. \\\\nSo I\\'m going to create a file called myswitches and in here I\\'m simply going to configure the IP addresses of our switches.\\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, on switch 1, the IP address is 192.168.122.72 So that\\'s the first switch CTRL K CTRL  U a few times. In our topology, it\\'s fairly simple. Our IP addresses are in that range but it doesn\\'t matter can configure any IP addresses. \\\\n\\\\nSo this is the IP address of the first switch and this is the IP address of the last switch. But this is a simple file and you could configure IP addresses in any range as needed in a file like this. \\\\nSo I\\'ll save that file and then I\\'ll just create a test. So let\\'s call this testloop.py. So what we can do here is open a file and say F equals open and what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to open is a file called myswitches. \\\\nWhat I can do is create a full loop now. So full line in F, print line and then I can close the file. So what this is going to do is print every line in the file called myswitches. So I\\'ll save the file. \\\\nSo what I can do now is run the Python script and notice it\\'s showing the output of the file. Now puts a carriage return at the end you can remove that if you need to. But once again we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re opening a file called myswitches and for every line in the file we\\'re simply printing the output of that a line and then once finished we are closing the file.\\\\n\\\\nSo again I\\'ll run the script and notice that\\'s the output of the script. So the gloss script I worked on was S1script 3 and what I\\'ll do now is copy that to a file called switchloopfile.py\\\\nNow it\\'s important that you use names that make sense to yourself. But for now that\\'s fine for what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. So I\\'ll open up that file and what we can do now is edit the script to use similar logic to what I just showed you.\\\\n\\\\nSo the first thing we\\'re going to do is open a file called myswitches and then we\\'re going to say rather than this, we\\'re going to say for line in f print configuring switch + line. So that\\'s just going to tell us what we currently configuring. \\\\nThe host is are going to be the line rather than this output and then we can keep the script as it was. So I\\'ll just format this better. According to the Python style guide, it\\'s better to use spaces rather than tabs. \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\'ll do that here to be consistent with the style guide. So that all looks right. \\\\nSo again the change we made is we are now opening up a file called myswitches and we\\'re using a full loop. So for each line in the file F which is a variable that consists of myswitches, we\\'re going to run the following code. So let\\'s test that. \\\\nSo switchloop.py it asked for our username , asked for a password and you can see that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that it\\'s configuring switch with that IP address.\\\\n\\\\nNow we\\'re configuring another switch. Notice we do see a lot of white space and if we scroll back we can see the output. So it\\'s configuring the third switch it created VLAN2 configuring the second switch, configuring the third switch, configuring the fourth switch and fifth switch. Now notice it only configured VLAN2....\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. \\\\n\\\\nIn this video we discuss how to write better code with the Python Style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. \\\\nThis is a very useful document to breed PEP 8 -  Style Guide for Python Code. A lot of people get hung up about how the way code is written and you\\'ll often find debates and people flaming one another when code isn\\'t written as neatly or as well as some people think it should be. \\\\nNow again using the idea of get started and learn, you can always improve the readability of your code and improve as you go along. But this is a document worth reading to try and write better code. \\\\n\\\\nSo one of the key insights taught here is that code is: read much more often than it is written so the idea of these guidelines is to improve the readability of code and make it consistent. So they say here style guide is about consistency, consistency with a style guide is important but consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. \\\\n\\\\nIf you don\\'t know what a module is or a function, don\\'t worry we\\'ll talk about them later. But notice there are always exceptions. Know when to be inconsistent. Sometimes Style Guide recommendations are just not applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. \\\\nHave a look at other examples and decide what looks best. Don\\'t hesitate to ask. They give you some good reasons to ignore a particular guideline. So as an example ignore a guideline if your code is less readable. \\\\n\\\\nYou may have to ignore the style guide to be consistent with old code. But you have some recommendations. Indentation is very important in Python so use 4 spaces per indentation level. They give you some recommendations for continuation lines. So as an example, this is good, but this is not good.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a section about tabs or spaces. Spaces are preferred, tabs should only be used to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs. \\\\n\\\\nPython 3 disallows the mixing of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to spaces exclusively. You can use the -t option with Python 2 to issue warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces. \\\\n\\\\nYou can use the -tt option to make those warnings errors. These options are highly recommended. The maximum line length is 79 characters that is a recommendation based on historical reasons. \\\\nSo for flowing a long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions, the line length should be limited to 72 characters that will allow you to open windows side-by-side so you can have multiple code windows open side-by-side. \\\\n\\\\nThere are a lot of other recommendations in this document and as you code and are unsure about how to space or how to indent or how to write your code, refer back to this document. I\\'ve linked at it below this video. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s one about string quotes. In Python single quoted strings and double quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick one rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string to improve readability. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s some pet peeves about white space. So avoid white space if not needed. So this is good, this is not good, this is good, this is not good, this is good, this is not good and so forth and so on. \\\\nTo improve your code, have a look at to the style guide. When in doubt, refer to this. Lots of recommendations are provided here. \\\\n\\\\nI hope you enjoyed it this video. If you did, please like it and please subscribe to my YouTube channel.\\\\n\\\\nI wish you all the very best!\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. In this video we program a Cisco IOSvL2 switch with VLANs by using Python on an Ubuntu Docker container.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScript on GitHub:\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/aaddef04d798f3ac538e93eca0d6d13f7b0100cd\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of the multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3.\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video, we created this out-of-band management network and you might say well I don\\'t have an out-of-band management network and that\\'s not a problem. We could simply delete the direct links between switches and build the topology in this way. You just need to be careful if you don\\'t have an out-of-band management network and you are making changes to interface, as an example, your script could be blocked if Spanning Tree is converging or something else happens on your network. So an out-of-band management network is preferred if you have that option. \\\\n\\\\nBut notice we could run our script again and as long as the script has IP connectivity to the devices in the network, it will be able to make configuration changes on those devices. So we\\'ve already made configuration changes to, in this example switch 4 and at this point my script is hanging because it may have a problem accessing switch 5 using in-band-management network. \\\\n\\\\nSo it looks like it didn\\'t complete. Let\\'s verify connectivity to the devices in the network. It looks like I was actually too impatient because it was busy configuring the switch. So show ip int brief\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s test if we can ping that switch and we can. So may have just needed to wait a bit for say for Spanning Tree to converge. That\\'s the problem with using an in-band-management network.\\\\nIf Spanning Tree is converging or there\\'s another problem on the network, your script or application will not have access to the network devices.\\\\n\\\\nSo here you can see it completed without any problems. An out-of-band management network is better than an in-band-management network. But that\\'s not always possible in all networks out in the real world.\\\\n\\\\nNow one thing we\\'re not doing in our script is saving the configurations of devices after we\\'ve made changes to them. So what I\\'ll do is simply add another line here called WR. You could do copy run start if you wanted to but I\\'m just going to use the abbreviated version. And now it\\'s a simple matter of running the script and letting the script save the configuration of the devices. \\\\n\\\\nSo if I connect to the console of switch 2, you can see that David has access it via telnet and you can see now that the configuration has been saved. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s jump to switch 3. You can see that David has access to it via telnet and again the switch configuration is being written and that\\'ll just continue. \\\\n\\\\nThis is again one of the advantages of using a script if you want to implement repetitive tasks such as configuring VLANs, scripting or programming is just so much better than doing it manually. \\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3.\\\\n\\\\nNow that we\\'ve been able to automate the configuration of both a Cisco IOSv router and an IOSv Layer 2 switch, we\\'ll now configure multiple switches at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ll drag 4 additional switches to the topology and we\\'ll connect them to the first IOSv switch.\\\\n\\\\nSo this is acting as a management network for let\\'s say a core and access layer. So these core switches will be connected to one another and they will be connected to the access switches.\\\\n\\\\nSo perhaps something like this. Now what you\\'re going to remember is, these links between switch1 and the rest of the switches in the topology is an out-of-band management network,\\\\nthese links between the switches would be the network used for user traffic. \\\\n\\\\nNow we could delete these links to the access layer, for now I\\'m going to leave them there but in a subsequent video we\\'ll use an in-band management VLAN rather than a dedicated link\"",

Now what you\\'re going to remember is, these links between switch1 and the rest of the switches in the topology is an out-of-band management network,\\\\nthese links between the switches would be the network used for user traffic. \\\\n\\\\nNow we could delete these links to the access layer, for now I\\'m going to leave them there but in a subsequent video we\\'ll use an in-band management VLAN rather than a dedicated link\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ll start up these switches. One of the parts that\\'s going to take the longest is configuring the IP addresses and other information on the switches. I\\'ll open up a console to the devices in the topology. \\\\n\\\\nSo the switches are currently booting up. While we\\'re waiting for all the switches\\\\nto boot up, let\\'s have a look at our Python script. The first thing I\\'m going to do is copy script2.py to scripty3.py and then we\\'ll use nano to edit script3. \\\\n\\\\nSo this is what the script currently looks like. \\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video I showed you how to use a range to configure VLANs on a single switch.Now what\\'s great about using Python directly is you can test things. So if I say range 10 notice it gives me a range from 0 to 9 there are 10 values in the range. \\\\n\\\\nIf I say range 74 notice it gives me a range from 0 to 73. \\\\n\\\\nSo if I say range 10 again it\\'s in the range 0 to 9. But if I specify 2, 10 that\\'s in the range from 2 to 9. So if I specify 5, 10 that\\'s 5 to 9. If I actually want to use numbers like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, then I need to specify 11. \\\\n\\\\nSo that\\'s something to remember when you create a loops using the range.\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video we wanted to create a VLANs 2 to 100. So I had to specify 101 in the range. Now that\\'s too many VLANs for what we\\'re going to do so let\\'s configure VLANs 2 to 10 on all switches in our topology. The great thing about building networks like this GNS3 is you can try things without being worried that you\\'ll break a live network. \\\\n\\\\nSo we can sort of take chances and learn and iterate our scripts as we going along without the fear of breaking a production Network. So what we\\'re going to do now is create a loop to automate the configuration of all the switches in one go. \\\\n\\\\nSo what we\\'ll do is we\\'ll configure the VLANs 2 to 10 on all the switches. \\\\n\\\\nNow the first thing we need to do is specify the IP address that we\\'re going to use for the\\\\ndevices. So currently we only have one IP address but what I want to do is loop through all the IP addresses of the switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo we\\'ll change the IP address to 192. 168.122.72 which is the IP address of the first switch. Which we can confirm by logging into the switch and by using the command show ip interface brief. \\\\n\\\\nSo there\\'s the IP address of the first switch. We\\'ve got 72. We\\'ll configure this switch as 73 74 75 and 76.\\\\n\\\\nSo we\\'ve got 5 switches. So we\\'ll use 77 here so that it goes in the range 72, 73, 74, 75, 76 to cover our five switches. \\\\n\\\\nNow to tell python that this host line belongs under the loop we need to add some whitespace. So I\\'ll just press tab there. We don\\'t, however, want to enter the username and password five times. So we\\'ll move that above the loop and then we\\'ll remove them here. \\\\n\\\\nSo the way the script will work is, it\\'ll ask us to enter the telnet username and password.\\\\nIn this case because we\\'re going to use the same username and password on all the switches, we only want to be prompted for that once. If the credentials were different on every switch we could add it as part of the loop. So we prompted for the credentials of the individual switches. \\\\n\\\\nSo we need to move all this code to the right, so that it\\'s under the loop.\"",

A loop is essentially telling the computer to do something for a certain amount of time. \\\\n\\\\nSo in this example I\\'m going to do a range. I\\'m going to say do the following in the range 2 to 10. Now in Python, spacing is very important. Think about how the Cisco IOS works or the IOS of many networking devices work. When we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at code so as an example, this code or configuration if you prefer of a Cisco router, do you agree that this space is very important?\\\\n\\\\nThis space indicates that this IP address is configured under this loopback. All of this code here belongs to this interface and so forth and so on. We know that this network command belongs under the OSPF routing process. \\\\n\\\\nIf I try to type network 0.0.0.0 here in global configuration mode, the router doesn\\'t accept it that space is telling us that this piece of code or configuration belongs under the routing process. This code belongs under this interface. So use that as an analogy for what we\\'re doing here. \\\\n\\\\nThe code that we\\'re now going to write belongs under the for-loop.  So what we\\'re going to write to the switch is vlan + n + carriage return. \\\\n\\\\nSo those two lines will allow us to replace the code that we\\'ve got here. What I\\'ll do is paste that back but notice I\\'m going to press tab. And what we want to do here is say + n + carriage return. \\\\n\\\\nNow when we run the script it\\'s going to fail because this is an integer and this is a string and I\\'ll talk about that in a moment.\\\\n\\\\nBut essentially what we\\'ve done is we\\'ve replaced all of this code with three lines and we can extend that by for instance doing 2 to 20. \\\\nSo what I\\'ll do is I\\'ll save that code and  I\\'ll run it but notice the problem when we run the code we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that line 23 in our script, in other words this line is mixing strings and integers. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'ll run Python directly and notice what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told when we enter type 1 in brackets?  We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that this is an integer. Type david that\\'s a string or type it this way is a string. But type let\\'s say 1.5 is a floating value.\\\\n\\\\nIntegers are whole numbers floating numbers as an example, allow us to have fractions in our numbers. Now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told once again that we can\\'t mix string and integer objects. So we\\'re not going to let that stop us. What we\\'re going to do here is change the integer to a string. And all we\\'re going to do is type string or str (n)  to change it to a string value and save the script. \\\\n\\\\nNow on the switch at the moment, show vlan shows us that we have Ethernet VLANs 1 to  8 \\\\nconfigured. We\\'re not going to worry about token ring and FDDI. But what happens when we run our script?\\\\n\\\\nSo David, put the password in and notice what happens. It\\'s creating VLANs 2 to  9.\\\\nSo previously we had 1 to 8 now show vlan brief shows us that we have  VLAN 9 and this is the power of loops.\\\\n\\\\nIf we want to add let\\'s say the VLANs 2 to 20, we simply change that one value, run our script again. Notice it\\'s created VLANs 2 to 19. \\\\n\\\\nSo show vlan brief, notice the VLANs are created.\\\\n\\\\nAnd one thing I should say is, if we want to create 2 to 20, we need to add one extra value there. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s run the script again. this is the great thing about programming. If you make a mistake,\\\\nyou can just correct it. And what\\'s great with GNS3 is you can actually see what your program or script is doing.\\\\n\\\\nSo notice we have VLAN 20 created. So it was as simple as that to write a script that creates multiple VLANs on a Cisco switch. It\\'s not a very long script it, only has a few lines in it. \\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s be a little bit ridiculous now and this is the power of programming. I\\'ll create a hundred VLANs on our switch. \\\\n\\\\nSo run the script again and while that\\'s running in the background, notice the VLANs are being created.  We can see 27 VLANs, now 32 VLANs, now we have 36.\\\\n\\\\nNow you may say that you could copy and paste from an Excel spreadsheet but remember with loops we can now create loops within loops. So what we could do is rather than just connecting to one switch,  we can loop across multiple switches and run this code across multiple switches.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. In this video we program a Cisco IOSvL2 switch with VLANs by using Python on an Ubuntu Docker container. \\\\n\\\\nScript used in this video is available on GitHub here: \\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/commit/da3045beca3c1b8766b2c9c92d2cdf55b3b8f7f1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. So currently we have two scripts: Python1script1 and Pythons1script1. What I\\'ll do is copy the s1 script to a file called s1script2.py notice we\\'ve changed the extension to the py \\\\n\\\\nIf I try and run at that script notice we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told that the command is not found. \\\\n\\\\nWe could still use Pythons1 and run the script this way and notice the changes have been made to the switch we can see here that the switch was configured. But we may want to improve things by simply running the script as follows. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s use nano to edit the script. \\\\n\\\\nNotice the difference it\\'s now showing the text in colors so that\\'s a lot nicer but what I\\'m also going to do is a reference Python in the script. \\\\n\\\\nNow in Unix and executable file that\\'s meant to be interpreted can indicate which interpreter to use by having hash exclamation mark or pound-bang if you prefer at the start of the first line followed by the interpreter. \\\\n\\\\nSo as an example, how does the operating system know if this is a bash script or a Python script? \\\\n\\\\nThis allows us to indicate that information so I\\'m going to save the script. Now when I run it, it\\'s still not running. A good Linux command is clear to clear the screen so at the \\\\nmoment we have our script but it\\'s not executable. I\\'m going to change the permissions on the script to make it executable. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'m going to specify that the script is now executable by adding the executable permission using change mod +x. Notice it\\'s a lowercase x.\\\\n\\\\nls now shows us that the script color has changed so I can now run the script simply by entering its name. And notice the script run. \\\\n\\\\nNow the best way to find files within this directory is to use ./ and then search for the name. Notice when I press tab it autocompletes but if I do this it\\'s not going to autocomplete. \\\\nSo get into the habit of using ./ for files in the local directory , I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll break that script. \\\\n\\\\nSo to prove that this works, nano and specify the script. So let\\'s edit the script and what I\\'ll do is simply add another VLAN to our switch. \\\\n\\\\nSo I\\'m going to specify VLAN_7 and give it a name of Python VLAN_7. I\\'ll save the script. \\\\n\\\\nSo on the switch show vlan brief shows us that we have VLANs 1 to 6 configured, that cat and the script name shows us that we\\'re going to add another VLAN to the switch. So I\\'ll run the script, enter username of david, enter my password of cisco. \\\\n\\\\nIn this example notice we are told that VLAN7 was created. on the switch we can see that David connected to vty 0 show vlan brief. We now have a new VLAN configured on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nNow remember, I\\'m not trying to do everything perfectly from the beginning. Babies don\\'t run marathons. Don\\'t try and  run a long distance marathon when you start out, don\\'t try to be the best programmer in the world. Just learn to get something done and then improve or to use a developer term iterate your program and refine it and make it better as you learn more.\\\\n\\\\nSo one of the things we may want to change here is to no longer embed our password of cisco. so we could delete to those two lines. Now before we delete stuff let\\'s create a backup. \\\\n\\\\nSo copy S1script2. And let\\'s call it S1script backup file. So we now have a backup of our file. If we have a problem we can always restore or copy back that backup file.\\\\n\\\\nSo nano again and let\\'s edit our script, so what I want to do here is I want to delete these two lines. So ctrl K cuts those two lines. And I\\'m going to save this script now that\\'s not going to work unless we do this change on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nSo on the switch we want to change the vty line to provide privileges as soon as we login. \\\\n\\\\nSo what we\\'ll do is do that on the user account. So we\\'ve got a user called david and we\\'ll say user david privilege 15 and to just prove that it works, show IP interface brief shows us the \\\\nIP address of the switch. So let\\'s telnet to ourselves and ensure that it works manually first.\\\\n\\\\n so david it\\'s a bit of a typo, can\\'t spell my own name, try again. Notice we are already in privilege mode so we can type conft straight away. So we don\\'t need the option enable. Show line shows us that no one\\'s connected at the moment. Let\\'s try and run our script. So david, cisco. Looks good, we can see that David logged into the switch.\"",

In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. In this video we program a Cisco IOSvL2 switch with VLANs by using Python on an Ubuntu Docker container.\\\\n\\\\nScript used in this video is available on GitHub here:\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/blob/master/pythonS1script1.py\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos teaching you network programmability using Python and GNS3. might take on the learning programming or any other technology is to just do it,try it make \\\\nmistakes, pick yourself up and try again.\\\\n\\\\n Don\\'t try and do it perfectly on the first run. Create some code and then iterate or improve and refine your code as you go along. GNS3 makes this process very easy. \\\\n\\\\nIn the previous video, I configured the router using a Python script. This is what our Python script looks like. We programmatically configured the loopback addresses and OSPF on the Cisco IOS of the router.\\\\n\\\\nNow let\\'s configure the switch. \\\\n\\\\nThe router was given this IP address through DHCP. What I\\'ll do is configure the switch manually on the SVI so IP address question mark. We have to specify the IP address here,so we\\'ll use 72. So hostname switch1. \\\\n\\\\nWe need to configure login details, so I\\'ll set an enable password a Cisco,I\\'ll set up a username of David, With a password of Cisco and on the vty lines, I\\'m going to use the command log in local and transport input all.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s manually test that telnet works a telnet to the IP address of the switch. Log in with our username of David, password of cisco enable put password in,  we can login, so we\\'ve proven that telnet works on the switch. \\\\n\\\\nOn the switch at the moment, show VLAN brief shows us that only the default VLANs are configured. \\\\n\\\\nNow previously we configured this Python script. \\\\n\\\\nWhat I\\'m going to do now is copy this Python script to another script called pythonS1script1\\\\n\\\\nAs I said in the previous video, we are not trying to do everything perfectly here we are trying to get started and we\\'ll iterate and improve as we go along. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s use an nano to edit that script. In this case the IP address of the switch is 192.168.122.72\\\\n\\\\n We\\'ll be prompted for our username and our password. \\\\n\\\\nWe\\'re going to telnet to that host. we are looking for a username and password prompt. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s confirm that that\\'s what we\\'re going to see. We are prompted for a username so that\\'s correct. We\\'re prompted for a password so that\\'s correct. \\\\n\\\\nSo the script will correctly look for and then enter those values. We\\'re going to send the enable command to the switch enter a password of cisco, then type conft and we\\'ll configure a VLAN of 2. \\\\n\\\\nNow you can as always refine this and improve it but I\\'m going to type exit and then create VLAN 3 and then exit and let\\'s get rid of all of this. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s control K that control U, paste it back control K, control U, control U. \\\\n\\\\nNow you could if you preferred just do this copy that and paste it in. So this creates VLANs 2, 3, 4, 5 6 control X, save the configuration. \\\\n\\\\nNow again before I run the script, notice we only have the default VLANs configured and what I\\'ll do now is type pythonS1script1 user name is David password is cisco. This is what was configured on the switch. We can see in the output of the switch that it was configured via telnet show VLAN. \\\\n\\\\nNotice the VLANs have been added to the VLAN database. VLAN 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 have been added it was as simple as that to use Python to configure a network switch. \\\\n\\\\nNow what we could do here is an example is set a description.\\\\n\\\\nSo Python VLAN2 as an example control X save the script, run it again and hopefully what we should see in the output here show VLAN. \\\\n\\\\nWhat\\'s nice about the output of the script is we see that there\\'s a problem I used the wrong command. So first manually test command is not supported so manually test and then automate. So let\\'s do that again. \\\\n\\\\nThe description is actually the name command save that, run the script again. I didn\\'t configure that manually it was configured by the scripts to show VLAN, notice the name has changed. \\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s do that for the other VLANs, control K, control U, control U, control U, control U, control U. This is one of the reasons why you want to use variables and the loops because it saves a lot of time doing this manually but we\\'ll leave that for a different script.\\\\n \\\\nSo python pythonS1script1 user name is david, password is cisco. \\\\n\\\\nWe see what was configured and if we type show VLAN we can see the configuration on the switch. This is the script that we created.\"",

In this video we program a Cisco IOSv router using Python on an Ubuntu Docker container.\\\\n\\\\nThe script used in this video is available on GitHub here:\\\\nhttps://github.com/davidbombal/pythonvideos/blob/master/pythonR1script1.py\\\\n\\\\nTranscription:\\\\n\\\\nThis is one of multiple videos discussing Python programming. Now there\\'s a lot of information on the internet with regards to Python programming, but in these series of videos I\\'m going to concentrate solely on the use of Python with networking devices and specifically with gns3 .\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m a very strong believer in practical learning. Think about it, when you were a child, did you go to university or school to learn how to ride a bike? Typically you learnt how to ride a bike by riding a bike and falling off a few times, making mistakes. But as you practiced you got better and better at riding a bike.\\\\n\\\\nI think the same is true for any other skill that you want to gain and any other knowledge that you want to obtain. The best way to do it is to just do it , make mistakes, pick yourself up and try again. And with that in mind I\\'m going to show you how quickly you can get programming a Cisco network using Python.\\\\n\\\\nIn Google I\\'ve done a search for Python telnet and my first hitch is the telnet library or telnet client available in Python 2.7. Now there\\'s a large debate in Python community about which version of Python you should learn. Python 2.7 is being replaced by Python 3. But notice on the Python website you can still download Python 2.7 and a lot of operating systems and network devices have version 2.7 by default. I\\'m going to show you both Python 2.7 and python 3 as part of these videos or as part of my GNS3 Python course. You may only have Python 2.7 available so it\\'s good to know that but you should also learn Python 3 for the future.\\\\n\\\\nSo notice the simple script that we can copy from the Python documentation. We\\'ll start off with a script and start programming our GNS3 topology.\\\\n\\\\nIn GNS3, I\\'m going to drag a iOS router to the workspace as well as an iOSv switch. These devices take a while to boot up, so to allow my docker containers to connect to the Internet quickly, I\\'m going to use a layer 2 switch.  One of the docker containers available is in a blue 2 container and that\\'s what I\\'m going to use in this topology rather than trying to get python running on your Windows PC or trying to get Python working on other operating systems. It\\'s going to be a lot quicker for us just to use a docker container and add that to our GNS3 topology.\\\\n\\\\nAgain, my belief is start or learning as quickly as you can, make mistakes and learn from that. Don\\'t get hung up with trying to learn the best way to do everything right away. Just get started.\\\\n\\\\nSome people believe that they need to have a degree to become a programmer or use programming skills in networking. I don\\'t necessarily agree with that. Just get started.\\\\n\\\\nSo on the Ubuntu machine I\\'m going to edit to the config. I\\'m going to set this device to use DHCP and click Save and click start. To boot up the network, I\\'m going to open up a console\\\\nto each device.\\\\n\\\\nNow again the Cisco devices will take a while to boot up but our docker container has already booted up and we can already ping google.com even though the switch and the router are still \\\\nbooting.\\\\n\\\\nSo how to get update? We will get update our references in ubuntu, that\\'s done, will install Python. \\\\n\\\\nIn this first example I\\'m going to install Python 2.7. So Python version of Python that we\\'re using is 2.7. 1. So here is the script that we\\'re going to start off with it\\'s not perfect. What we will be doing now is not necessarily the most optimized way of implementing a script like this but the \\\\nidea there is, we want to get started, get it working by for instance creating a loop back on the router and configuring VLANs on the switch and then we can build on our script and optimize it.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'m going to use nano to create a file so let\\'s call this python Router1 script 1 to start off with. And then I\\'m going to paste the code off the internet into nano. so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re importing modules here get passes telnet library.\\\\n\\\\nThe device that we\\'re going to telnet to is going to be the router. So we need to configure the router\\'s IP address, username and password and other details for when the script telnets \\\\nto the router. So before we continue with our script let\\'s configure the network devices. See here\\'s the router it\\'s booted up. Now I\\'ll bypass the initial configuration dialog.\\\\n\\\\nTranscription limited by YouTube.\"",
