Each page has a fixed header and contains multiple rows, with each row having a record header followed by its respective columns. When the database fetches a page and places it in the shared buffer pool, we gain access to all rows and columns within that page. So, the question arises: if we have all the columns readily available in memory, why would SELECT * be slow and costly? Is it really as slow as people claim it to be? And if so why is it so?

    "desc": "Node is a non-blocking Javascript runtime. You can concurrently run an HTTP Server, read files from disk, send UDP datagrams, accept TCP connections from clients and still have room to execute Javascript code operations without blocking. Most of these operations are known as I/O, you send an input to a device, file or a socket and it replies back with an output. Node achieves non-blocking I/O with mostly a single thread executed asynchronously using a library called lib_uv.\\\\nThe exception being DNS queries, which use a thread pool. This means when you use fetch or axios to make an HTTP request to a domain, the DNS resolution for that domain will most probably go through the thread pool, while the actual request itself will be sent asynchronously on the main thread.\\\\n\\\\nIn this episode of the backend engineering show I go through an article I wrote discussing NodeJS Asynchronous I/O. \\\\n\\\\nhttps://medium.com/@hnasr/when-nodejs-i-o-blocks-327f8a36fbd4\\\\n\\\\nLearn the fundamentals of network engineering, get my udemy course \\\\nhttps://network.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n3:00 Part 1 Socket/IO\\\\n9:48 Part 2 File I/O\\\\n12:42 Part 3 DNS\\\\n16:22 Part 4 NodeJS Single Threaded\\\\n19:10 Part 5 NodeJS Thread Pool\\\\n21:23 Part 6 DNS lookup bottleneck in Node\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Networking for Effective Backends udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://network.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Database Engineering udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://database.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction to NGINX  (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://nginx.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nPython on the Backend (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://python.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nBuy me a coffee if you liked this\\\\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/hnasr\\\\n\\\\nArabic Software Engineering Channel \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWZsjdoRvZ0T9QWZOD6UpA\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 Members Only Content\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUMO_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nGears and tools used on the Channel (affiliates)\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x96\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Slides and Thumbnail Design \\\\nCanva\\\\nhttps://partner.canva.com/c/2766475/647168/10068\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

Understand the backend communication design patterns, protocols, execution and proxying. Link redirects to udemy with latest coupon applied.\\\\n\\\\nBackend engineering is an art. During my 18 years career working with and building backend applications, I discovered certain communication design patterns keep emerging. There are only handful of ways clients communicate with backend applications, although they might be more, I believe the patterns I discuss in this course are the most common. Examples of these patterns are request-response, publish-subscribe, short and long and push.\\\\n\\\\nBased on these communication design patterns, engineers may use a number of protocols for concrete communication. While the fundemental protocols boils down to either TCP or UDP, tons of industry specific protocols are built on top of these two to address certain problems. Examples of these high level protocols are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, QUIC, gRPC, WebRTC and many more. Each protocol has its pros and cons and fits certain use cases. In the course, I discuss the top common protocols and provide examples and demos where applicable.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the request reaches the backend, the application has to execute the request. The backend has a buffet of design choices when it comes to the style of execution it can choose. Understanding the difference between a process and a thread, multi-process, multi-threaded and the correlation to the number of CPU cores or hardware threads is crucial to pick the right execution pattern. One does not have to stick with these patterns but can invent new ones that suits their needs.\\\\n\\\\nThis course is designed for engineers who have built backend applications, it is an intermediate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 advance level course, certain programming and networking knowledge is required so I recommend taking my fundamentals of network engineering course before taking this course if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the networking skills.

Middle routers have buffers that hold the packets (segments to be exact) temporarily to be processed and routed to the next destination. When the buffer is filled up new packets will be dropped by those routers which causes an indication by the sender that some packets are getting lost. This signals a congestion of the network (new papers challenge definitions such as the Homa paper but it\\'s outside the scope of this post) when a congestion is detected the congestion control slows down transmission by flipped between several algorithms. We discuss in this post the two major algorithms, the slow start and the congestion avoidance.\\\\n\\\\nThe transmission starts with the slow start algorithm with an initial  congestion window size of specific value (the CWND controls the congestion), the slow starts increases the CWND with 1 maximum segment size (around 1500 bytes in most cases) for each acknowledgment the sender gets. This continues until the CWND reaches the slow start threshold (SSTHRES) the algorithm then changes to the congestion avoidance. In the congestion avoidance algorithm, the CWND is increased by 1 MSS for each round trip (not each ack), this means if your CWND is 5 segments worth of size, sending 5 segments and getting acknowledgment for the entire 5 segments will get you an increase of 1 MSS to your CWND. This is as opposed to slow start where if you receive 5 acknowledgments you get +5 MSS to your CWND. That is why Slow Start starts slow but increases aggressively. While congestion avoidance increases slowly.\\\\n\\\\nWhen congestion is detected , the slow start threshold is reduced by however many unacknowledged  segments that are in flights (flight size) divided by two (not as commonly mistakenly CWND/2), Flight size is usually lower than CWND. The CWND is also reset to 1 MSS which then kicks back the slow start algorithm again since the CWND is lower than the slow start threshold. This goes on over and over again until the slow start threshold becomes equal or less than the value of 2MSS. That is where slow start. \\\\n\\\\nIn this video I explain the difference between the two algorithms and how they each take effect in transmission.\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc5681.txt.pdf\\\\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/replaceTcp.pdf\\\\n\\\\nTCP Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance are algorithms used in TCP congestion control.

There is this new toddler song \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive little monkeys jumping on the bed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where it starts with five monkeys jumping on the bed and one falls off the bed and the mom calls the doctor and then another monkey falls and the mom calls the doctor again. This keeps going until all monkeys are no longer on the bed. \\\\n\\\\nThis clearly looks like a software engineering problem. In the face of it is extreme inefficiency in IO with the mom calling the doctor 5 times in span of 3 minutes. The mom could decide to wait for all monkeys to fall and call the doctor once. A Method that is known as batching. \\\\n\\\\nTwo problems with this approach; the first is latency the mom can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait, she is worried, she needs immediate answer from the doctor for the first monkey that fell.\\\\n\\\\nThe second problem is we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if more monkeys are going to fall off the bed, so while the mom waiting, the first monkey will be in pain and will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstarve\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\\\n\\\\nWe makes decisions like this constantly in software engineering. In some database systems for example commits from transactions are grouped and batched for few microseconds/milliseconds so more commits can arrive and the database can flush/fsync the WAL once. This is specially important in highly concurrent system because disk fsync is costly and bypasses the operating system cache. However, this comes at a cost of slight delay in transaction commits but less IO in general. \\\\n\\\\nTo batch or not to batch. The five little monkey problem doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have one right solution it all depends. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Networking for Effective Backends udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://network.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Database Engineering udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://database.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction to NGINX  (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://nginx.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nPython on the Backend (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://python.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nArabic Software Engineering Channel \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWZsjdoRvZ0T9QWZOD6UpA\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 Members Only Content\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUMO_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nGears and tools used on the Channel (affiliates)\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x96\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Slides and Thumbnail Design \\\\nCanva\\\\nhttps://partner.canva.com/c/2766475/647168/10068\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "We are entering an era in software engineering where we rely on libraries and frameworks to do most of our work. While this is useful and save tremendous dev hours, it creates leaky abstractions that manifest in form of performance degradation, unexpected errors, 100% CPU , network and disk usage, hangs, latency and many other. It becomes difficult to articulate what goes wrong on the backend and how to fix it when engineers don\\'t understand the basic building block of what they are interacting with. \\\\n\\\\nNetwork communication is one of the most critical pieces in backend engineering. And the TCP/IP\\xc2\\xa0Internet suite is the basic fundemntal building block of communications that link the frontend to the backend. Any protocol we use eventually gets encapsulated into either a TCP segment or UDP datagram. That packet is wrapped in an IP packet which is placed into a frame and then sent across the network. These layers are important to understand for backend engineers in order to optimize the stack, minimize latency, and increase throughput. What matters\\xc2\\xa0 is the true understanding of these pieces and not just memorizing definitions and packet headers to pass an exam. If an engineer truly understood what is happening when their backend API\\xc2\\xa0receives an HTTP\\xc2\\xa0POST request for example, they will be astonished at how much is happening behind the scenes. They would completely change the way they approach backend API designs, they will try to select the best protocol for the job, and they will tune that protocol to its maximum potential. They will start asking questions about frameworks and libraries that nobody else does. It is those questions that will make them fully utilize those framework to their maximum potential. \\\\n\\\\nThis course is primarily designed for backend engineers who built applications, services or APIs and want to take their skillset to the next level. If you are a frontend engineer who are interested in the backend and have attempted to build backend apps before this course is also for you. If you are a network engineer who already know the basic fundamentals and want to start building backend applications effectively this course might help you bridge the gap\\\\n\\\\nThis course is not designed for those who want to pass network certification tests (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc..)\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Networking for Effective Backends udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://network.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFundamentals of Database Engineering udemy course (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://database.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction to NGINX  (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://nginx.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nPython on the Backend (link redirects to udemy with coupon)\\\\nhttps://nginx.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 Members Only Content\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUMO_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nGears and tools used on the Channel (affiliates)\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x96\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Slides and Thumbnail Design \\\\nCanva\\\\nhttps://partner.canva.com/c/2766475/647168/10068\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "The cost of a long-running update transaction that eventually failed in Postgres (or any other database for that matter. \\\\n\\\\nIn Postgres, any DML transaction touching a row creates a new version of that row. if the row is referenced in indexes, those need to be updated with the new tuple id as well. There are exceptions with optimization such as heap only tuples (HOT) where the index doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to be updated but that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always happens. \\\\n\\\\nIf the transaction rolls back, then the new row versions created by this transaction (millions in my case) are now invalid and should NOT be read by any new transaction. You have two solutions to address this, do you clean all dead rows eagerly on transaction rollback? Or do you do it lazily as a post process? \\\\n\\\\nPostgres does the lazy approach, a command called vacuum which is called periodically Postgres attempts to remove those dead rows and free up space in the page. \\\\n\\\\nWhats the harm of leaving those dead rows in? Its not really correctness issues at all, in fact transactions know not to read those dead rows by checking the state of the transaction that created them. This is however expensive, the check to see of the transaction that created this row is committed or rolled-back.  Also the fact that those dead rows live in disk pages with alive rows makes an IO not efficient as the database has to filter out dead rows. For example, a page may have contained 1000 rows, but only 1 live row and 999 dead rows, the database will make that IO but only will get a single row of it. Repeat that and you end up making more IOs. More IOs = slower performance.\\\\n\\\\nOther databases do the eager approach and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let you even start the database before rolling back is successfully complete, using undo logs. Which one is right and which one is wrong? Here is the fun part! Nothing is wrong or right, its all decisions that we engineers make. Its all fundamentals. Its up to you to understand and pick. Anything can work. You can make anything work if you know what you are dealing with. \\\\n\\\\nIf you want to learn about the fundamentals of databases and demystify it check out my udemy course https://database.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 Members Only Content\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUMO_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg\\\\n\\\\nSupport my work on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xab Courses I Teach\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/courses \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nGears and tools used on the Channel (affiliates)\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x96\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Slides and Thumbnail Design \\\\nCanva\\\\nhttps://partner.canva.com/c/2766475/647168/10068\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Mic Gear\\\\nShure SM7B Cardioid Dynamic Microphone  \\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3o1NiBi\\\\n\\\\nCloudlifter\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/2RAeyLo\\\\n\\\\nXLR cables\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3tvMJRu\\\\n\\\\nFocusrite Audio Interface\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3f2vjGY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xb7 Camera Gear\\\\nCanon M50 Mark II\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3o2ed0c\\\\n\\\\nMicro HDMI to HDMI \\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3uwCxK3\\\\n\\\\nVideo capture card\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3f34pyD\\\\n\\\\nAC Wall for constant power\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3eueoxP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "A summary of the outage that happened to the Facebook network on October 4th, 2021. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOn October 4th, 2021, Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp disappeared from the Internet for 6 hours. This is one of the major Internet outages in 2021\\\\n\\\\nIn this video, I\\'ll summarize the cause of the outage, why did it take that long to restore, and finally go in detail reading both facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Cloudflare\\'s articles and give my thoughts. Let\\'s get into it\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe Internet can be thought of as a network of networks connected and advertised by a protocol called BGP (border gateway protocol)\\\\n\\\\nThis protocol defines proper routes to get from one network to another and allows for multiple paths and routes options, redundancy, and efficient shortest path routing\\\\n\\\\nNetworks constantly update the routes in case of a change to propose better routes or more redundant paths.\\\\n\\\\nWhat happened? \\\\n\\\\nNow that we know how the Internet routes traffic, what exactly happened that caused Facebook to go dark\\\\n\\\\n around 8:50 AM PST the Facebook network stopped advertising its presence to the other routers on the Internet. This was due to a configuration change Facebook made to their backbone router. \\\\n\\\\nThis means any IP address that belongs to the Facebook network cannot be routed since there are no longer any paths available. \\\\n\\\\nThe problem was first noticed with DNS, DNS requests to facebook.com were timing out. DNS servers have IP addresses just like any other server, and since Facebook Authoritative DNS servers which are located on the Facebook network couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be reached, the DNS resolvers couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t route DNS requests to them and as a result timeout.  \\\\n\\\\nEven if you did manage to get an IP address of facebook.com cached you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to route to it as the paths disappeared. \\\\n\\\\nWhy did it take so long? \\\\n\\\\nMy guess is internal tools that Facebook used to make the configuration update were locked behind and couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be accessed mainly because everyone is working remotely. This might have made the job of reverting the configuration change harder. This is another reason why we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get outage updates either. \\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\nhttps://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/\\\\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/\\\\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-july-17-2020/\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/nRjyEezdwsQ\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\xa5 Members Only Content\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUMO_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg\\\\n\\\\nSupport my work on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xab Courses I Teach\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/courses \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nGears and tools used on the Channel (affiliates)\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x96\\xbc\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Slides and Thumbnail Design \\\\nCanva\\\\nhttps://partner.canva.com/c/2766475/647168/10068\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Mic Gear\\\\nShure SM7B Cardioid Dynamic Microphone  \\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3o1NiBi\\\\n\\\\nCloudlifter\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/2RAeyLo\\\\n\\\\nXLR cables\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3tvMJRu\\\\n\\\\nFocusrite Audio Interface\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3f2vjGY\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xb7 Camera Gear\\\\nCanon M50 Mark II\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3o2ed0c\\\\n\\\\nMicro HDMI to HDMI \\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3uwCxK3\\\\n\\\\nVideo capture card\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3f34pyD\\\\n\\\\nAC Wall for constant power\\\\nhttps://amzn.to/3eueoxP\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "On April 20th, 2021, Auth0 US environments had a full-service disruption. The outage was due purely to performance degradation on their internal backend systems. \\\\n\\\\nAuth0 has released a root cause analysis report and In this video, I will summarize their backend architecture and the cause of the outage. Let us get started\\\\n\\\\nJust an FYI I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only going through the backend pieces that auth0 explained in their RCA which isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t their entire backend infrastructure. \\\\n\\\\nThe Auth0 feature flag service returns configuration values for tenants and subscribers which is stored in MongoDB.  (Although Auth0 doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention this on the RCA we know their core database MongoDB from a previous blog that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll reference below ) \\\\n\\\\nThe feature flag service also has a caching layer which the frontend apis can query for performance. If cache  doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the value or takes too long to answer, the frontend api queries the flag feature directly which hits the MongoDB directly. \\\\n\\\\nAuth0 also execute multiple queries running on the backend for routine maintenance. These queries where identified as inefficient and consume lots of resources primarily because they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have proper indexes. \\\\n\\\\nAs a result of a sudden increase in traffic, the flag service caching layer was saturated which caused latency in response time, eventually causing the frontend apis to massively query the feature flag service directly putting even more load on the MongoDB.\\\\n\\\\nCombined with the backend inefficient queries, MongoDB received even more queries and consumed more IO resources which caused latency to increase even further\\\\n\\\\nThe auto-scaling triggered  in the feature service as a result of latency in response time to scale the service adding even more load to MongoDB\\\\n\\\\nthis eventually overloaded the database until it exceeded the available disk I/O which caused the full outage. \\\\n\\\\nIf you love this content I think you will enjoy this video where I discuss the Slack outage, I learned so much about Slack backend architecture from making this video click here to watch.\\\\n\\\\nI will make another video where I go through the root cause analysis in details so If you are new here make sure to like and subscribe so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t miss the video. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\nhttps://status.auth0.com/incidents/zvjzyc7912g5\\\\nhttps://cdn.auth0.com/blog/Detailed_Root_Cause_Analysis_(RCA)_4-2021.pdf\\\\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/database-caching-strategies-using-redis/caching-patterns.html\\\\nhttps://auth0.com/blog/how-we-store-data-in-the-cloud-at-auth0/#Redis\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\x9b\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Software Archtiecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa9 Messaging Systems\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVcumYRWE2w9kVxxIXy_AMo\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victim\\xe2\\x80\\x99s process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system process separation, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing and side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems since vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices. While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n* Intro 0:00\\\\n* How CPU Cache works 1:00\\\\n* Spectre Explained 3:00\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nhttps://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\x9b\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Software Archtiecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa9 Messaging Systems\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVcumYRWE2w9kVxxIXy_AMo\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

Lets get into it\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft services rely on Azure active directory for authentication and authorization.\\\\n\\\\nEach service gets a token and verifies the token with a signing key \\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x91 to make sure the token is still valid. And as part of automated security hygiene, Microsoft does a key rotation and invalidate keys that is no longer used. \\\\n\\\\nThere was a bug in the automated key rotation that removed a signing key that was not supposed to be removed. Unfortunately, this key signed so many tokens that are being used by many services \\\\n\\\\nAs a result of that removal, the metadata about the keys has been downloaded by all services, and all those tokens were marked as invalid (key is no longer trusted). \\\\n\\\\nUsers connecting to these services started to get errors because of this.\\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft engineering quickly realized that and reverted the metadata to force the key to be trusted again\\\\n\\\\nHowever, because each service already cached that knowledge that the key was untrusted it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t refresh the new metadata (cache invalidation is the most difficult problem)\\\\n\\\\nThat exacerbated the problem, some services went down while others remain untrusting those token\\\\n\\\\nEngineers finally pushed a fix to force a refresh of keys metadata to force services to pull new metadata and trust the key again \\\\n\\\\nThis is when the services started coming back to normal, \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRCA\\\\nhttps://status.azure.com/en-us/status/history/\\\\n\\\\nSlides for this video\\\\nhttps://payhip.com/b/RoCa\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\x9b\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Software Archtiecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa9 Messaging Systems\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVcumYRWE2w9kVxxIXy_AMo\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\nJoin our Thriving Backend Community on Discord \\\\nhttps://discord.com/invite/CsFbFce \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "In this video, I will discuss the new TLS extension Encrypted Client Hello which is a new mechanism to encrypt the entire client hello, very interesting and elegantly design but I have my few reservations and criticisms. Let us discuss. \\\\n\\\\nIntro 0:00 \\\\nClassic TLS with SNI 7:00\\\\nESNI 9:30\\\\nECH 12:30 \\\\nLimitations and Problems 21:00 \\\\n \\\\nLet\\'s say the backend server hosts example.com with the cert of example.com and let us call this the \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SNI. To support ECH, the same server should also host a client facing cert, lets call it server-ech.com with corresponding server-ech.com cert. So your server IP address is hosting two domains. example.com and ( server-ech.com just to support ech)\\\\n\\\\nSo when you perform an oDoH/DoH query looking for example.com you will get back the IP address of example.com, (which is the same ip address as server-ech.com), you will also get the ephemeral public key of example.com from the HTTPSSVC DNS record. This will be used to encrypt the inner client hello, and finally, you will get a record of the front-facing server domain name which is server-ech.com. \\\\n\\\\nThe client prepares the TLS ECH, it builds the outer client hello with the SNI value as server-ech.com, and the inner client hello with the real SNI (example.com) along side ALPN and other stuff.. \\\\n\\\\nIt then uses the public key of example.com retrieved from the HTTPS DNS record to encrypt the inner client hello. The client sends the ECH. \\\\n\\\\nServer receives the ECH, and attempts to decrypt the inner client hello with the corresponding ephemeral private key, if it succeeds it then completes the server hello and key exchange as normal.\\\\n\\\\nif it fails to decrypt the inner client hello with its own private key that means the public key used, was stale, outdated, bad etc.. . The client then uses the outer client hello and it checks, do I have server-ech.com, yes I do have a cert for that, let me just finish the key exchange and server hello with that instead, and btw, here is my REAL public key for example.com so you can use it for future ECHs. the public key is going to be encrypted for sure (that was something not clear in the article) because its TLS 1.3 and things are immediately encrypted from the server.  The client then finishes the handshake and finds out the public key and immediately terminate the connection and re-establishes it with brand new encrypted inner client hello that uses the new server public key which we know this time its going to work ..\\\\n\\\\nI can image getting into an infinite loop if the server accidentally gave a wrong public key. also some cons of ECH comes to mind  is the larger client hello + the additional backend management to host that client facing server and cert. Also another question, what If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hosting 100 domains on my single IP address, do I get a single ephmeral public key for ECH? or is it per domain? and how does my server know what private key to use to decrypt, does it just try them one by one? or is there an indication to which public key was used to encrypt the inner client hello..  (I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m guessing there is )\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\x9b\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Software Archtiecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa9 Messaging Systems\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVcumYRWE2w9kVxxIXy_AMo\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\nJoin our Thriving Backend Community on Discord \\\\nhttps://discord.com/invite/CsFbFce \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

Curl works with many protocols, and written in C. Daniel is the best person to explain any communication protocol because he actually built the client that speaks protocols. Just watch his HTTP videos and you will understand what I mean.  Another thing I like is how he runs the curl project and how he focuses on the fundamentals and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a knee-jerk reaction to any modern hype tech that shows up. \\\\n\\\\n@securitynow \\\\nSecurity Now (Networking, Security)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/TWiTSecurityNow\\\\n\\\\nSteve Gibson Security Now amplified my knowledge exponentially in the past two years. His generosity in explaining things slowly and thoroughly makes you enjoy listening to him in the background. Although Steve\\'s show focuses on security topics and recent events he showed me how the Internet really works through carefully explaining inner networking.\\\\n\\\\n@percona \\\\nPercona  (Databases, mySQL, postgres, Mongo etc)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLJ0Ok4HeUBrRYF4irturVA\\\\n\\\\nPercona makes content on multiple databases platforms such as postgres mysql mariadb mongo and they compare the performance and efficiency of those databases side by side. If you ever want to pick a DB over another one you have to follow their work. \\\\n\\\\nUsed to pronounce it Persona (the game) for over a year until someone corrected me\\\\n\\\\n@EDBPostgres \\\\nEnterprise DB (Postgres)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIPoYyNr1OHgTo0KwE9HJw\\\\n\\\\nEnterprise DB contributions to PostgresSQL code base is very valuable. Their videos about postgres inner working make you appreciate this beautiful database even more.\\\\n\\\\n@CMUDatabaseGroup \\\\nCMU Database Group (Database concept)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnBsf2rH-K7pn09rb3qvkA\\\\n\\\\nCarnegie million university database group youtube channel is a gem for understanding the fundamentals of databases. Long-form lecture content for free. \\\\n\\\\n@Computerphile \\\\nComputerphile (Security, Networking, Computer Science)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA\\\\n\\\\nThe British computer Science professors alliance in computerphile is a must follow when it comes to security and networking ( my favorite is Dr Mike Pound) \\\\n\\\\n@JeffGeerling \\\\nJeff Geerling\\xc2\\xa0 (k8, docker, clustering raspberry pi)\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/geerlingguy\\\\n\\\\nJeff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s videos on raspberry pi clustering and k8 are great. His skills to say what he wants to say in digestible short videos is what makes his videos enjoyable to watch. Something I am actively working on getting better at. \\\\n\\\\n@TechDummiesNarendraL \\\\nTech Dummies Narendra L\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn1XnDWhsLS5URXTi5wtFTA\\\\n\\\\nNareen doesn\\'t post often but I really enjoy his down to earth look at system design.

    "desc": "Transport Layer Security is the protocol used to encrypt the Internet.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of TLS is to agree on the same key between parties that will be used to encrypt the traffic. In this video I will explain how the TLS handshake happens.\\\\n\\\\nThe client starts the handshake by generating 3 numbers, g and n which are public and x which is private.\\\\n\\\\nThe client sends g, n and parameter g raised to the power x modulo n. It is very difficult for anyone sniffing to extract x from this parameter. \\\\n\\\\nThe server receives the client hello and generates a private number y. \\\\n\\\\nThe server then raises the client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s parameter to the power of y and does a modulo of n and with basic math this is equal to g to the power x multiplied by y module n, this now becomes the key. \\\\n\\\\nThe server sends its hello with g raised to the power of y modulo n, again very hard to extract y from this. Server also sends many other information here such as certificates. \\\\n\\\\nthe client raises server parameter to the power of x which equates to g to the power x multiplied by y module n.\\\\n\\\\nBoth the client and server has the same key, this key exchange algorithm is called diffie hellman\\\\n\\\\nLet us go through an example to explain this. client generates g is 10, n is 7 and x which is the private number as 2, the client calculates its parameter by raising 10 to the power of 2 module 7 resulting in 2. \\\\n\\\\nThe client sends its parameter 2, along side g and n\\\\n\\\\nThe server receives the parameters, calculates its private number y as 3. Server raises client parameter 2 to the power of 3 module 7 which results in the 1 that is the key.\\\\n\\\\nServer sends its parameter which is g to the power of y module n which results in 6  \\\\n\\\\nClient raises server parameter 6 to the power of 2 module 7 which results in the 1 . It is very important to have n as large number in classical diffie hellman key exchange but this is not case with eliptic curve diffie hellman key exchange\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe client and server hellos have lots of other information as well, such as the type of cipher algorithm to use which is fed the number they just agreed upon, certificates, TLS extensions and more!  We demonstrated TLS 1.3 in this video TLS 1.2 has an extra round trip. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you are interested in more details check out the playlist in the card where I made many videos on TLS.

After that Ill provide a lengthy deep dive of the incident so make sure to stick around for that. \\\\n\\\\nIf you are new here, I make backend engineering videos and also cover software news, so make sure to Like comment and subscribe if you would like to see more plus it really helps the channel, lets jump into it.\\\\n\\\\nSo This is an approximation of Slack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s architecture based on what was the described in the reports. Clients connects to load balancers, load balancers distribute requests to backend servers and backend servers finally make requests to database servers which is powered by mysql through vitess sharding. All of those are connected by routers in cross boundary network. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAround 6AM jan 4 , the cross network boundary routers setting between LB and backend and backend to DB started to drop packets. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis lead to the load balancers slowly marking backends as unhealthy and removing them from the fleet Which compounded the number of requests\\\\n\\\\nThe number of failed requests eventually triggered the provisioning service to start spinning an absurdly large number of backend servers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHowever the provisioning service couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep up with the huge demand and shortly started to time out for the same networking reasons and eventually ran out  of maximum open file handles.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEventually Slack\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cloud provider increased the networking capacity and backend servers went back to normal around 11 AM PST\\\\n\\\\nThis was a summary of the slack outage, Now set back, grab your favorite beverage and lets go through the detailed incident report! \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Outage Summary\\\\n2:00 Detailed Analysis Starts\\\\n5:20 The Root Cause\\\\n30:00 Corrective Actions\\\\n\\\\nLinks\\\\nhttps://slack.engineering/slacks-outage-on-january-4th-2021/\\\\nhttps://status.slack.com/2021-01/9ecc1bc75347b6d1#:~:text=Customers%20may%20have%20trouble%20connecting%20to%20or%20using%20Slack\\\\u0026text=Starting%20around%206%3A00%20a.m.,t%20usable%20for%20all%20customers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupport my work on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n \\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xab Courses I Teach\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/courses \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

As the offset increase, the database is doing more work which makes this operation extremely expensive. \\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the problem with offset is you might accidentally read duplicate records. consider the user now want to read page 11 and meanwhile someone inserted a new row in the table, row 111 will be read twice\\\\n\\\\nLet us jump and test this against postgres\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Why Offset is Bad\\\\n2:30 Offset Example\\\\n5:45 Offset alternative\\\\n\\\\nUse the Index Luke Blog \\\\nhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset\\\\n\\\\nSlides in this video\\\\nhttps://payhip.com/b/B6o1\\\\n(Members get all slides for free.

You can find youtube chapters to jump to the interesting part of the video. pick your favorite drink, sit back relax and enjoy. Lets get started. \\\\n\\\\nlets start with an overview of how the google id service works, the client connects to google authentication service to get authenticated or retrieve account information\\\\n\\\\nThe account information is stored in a distributed manner between the different service ids for redundancy.\\\\n\\\\nwhen an update is made to an account on the leader node, the existing data in all nodes are marked as outdated, this is done for security reasons. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say you updated your credit card info, privated your profile or deleted a comment, it is extremely dangerous to serve those outdated information. This was the key to the outage. \\\\n\\\\nThe updated account is then replicated based on paxos Consensus protocol. \\\\n\\\\nThe user id service has a storage quota controlled by an automated quota management solution, when the storage usage of the service changes. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n the quota is maintained accordingly either reduced or increased based on the demand .. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSo What Exactly Happened that caused the outage? \\\\n\\\\nIn October 2020, google migrated their quota management to a new system and registered the id service with the new system.\\\\n\\\\nhowever some parts of the old system remained hooked up specifically the parts regarding the reading of the service usage. And because the service is registered to the new system, the old qouta system reported 0 usage as it should. So when the new quota manement  asked its service for its usage it was incorrectly reporting 0. \\\\n\\\\nNothing happened for a while since there was a grace period, but that period expired on December\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThats when the new quota system kicked and saw the id service with 0 usage and started reducing the qouta for the id service down .. you are not using it why waste?  \\\\n\\\\nThe quota kept reducing until the service had no space left. \\\\n\\\\nThis has caused updates to the leader node to fail, which caused all data to go out of date in all nodes which in turn escalated globally to what we have seen.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nResource\\\\nhttps://status.cloud.google.com/incident/zall/20013\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSupport my work on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n \\\\nBecome a Member on YouTube\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xab Courses I Teach\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/courses \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos in Order\\\\nhttps://backend.husseinnasser.com\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

If the client manages to decrypt the message that means it owns the private key and it will let it in. \\\\n\\\\nThank you so much for watching, subscribe for more and if you want to see how I enable password-less authentication on my raspberrypi you may stay little longer for that. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nssh-keygen -t rsa\\\\nssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n30 encryption https://youtu.be/Z3FwixsBE94\\\\n\\\\nclear ssh authorized_keys in /home/pi/.ssh\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8e\\x99\\xef\\xb8\\x8fListen to the Backend Engineering Podcast\\\\nhttps://husseinnasser.com/podcast \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Backend Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUNnO4p00ua_C5mKTfldiYT\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\x9b\\xef\\xb8\\x8f Software Archtiecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa9 Messaging Systems\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVcumYRWE2w9kVxxIXy_AMo\\\\n\\\\nBecome a Member \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ML5xP23TOWKUcc-oAE_Eg/join\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

The DoH server knows the DNS query because it has to decrypt the packet and it also knows the client IP address\\\\n\\\\nSo bad or misbehaving DoH servers may decide to log and sell this data to the highest bidder\\\\n\\\\nThat is why Apple, Fastly and Cloudflare came up with a new technology called oblivious DNS over HTTPs or oDOh! \\\\n\\\\noDoH adds a proxy layer in the middle so the resolver doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the original client IP address and the entire communication is encrypted end-to-end so even the proxy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the content of the dns query.

We have now fully mitigated the impact to the subsystem within Kinesis that is responsible for the processing of incoming requests and are no longer seeing increased error rates or latencies. However, we are not yet taking the full traffic load and are working to relax request throttles on the service. Over the next few hours we expect to relax these throttles to previous levels.

It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing.

It is like driving a volvo all your life and then switching to a Ferrari and saying it was a mistake because its too fast. I disagree with the solutions of throttling the LB and I think the app should either be architected to not send this much requests if possible or just add more servers since HTTP is stateless you should be able to scale.

    "desc": "Engineers are incredibly smart people. This could be a product of the complex problems they usually work on and the abundance of solutions a given problem can have. This is especially true for software engineering problems. With so many roads leading to Rome, it becomes attractive for engineers to favor the idea they came up with over others.\\\\n\\\\nEngineers are arrogant. I say that as an engineer myself. I have been guilty of assuming I know more than most people in the room. Or that my way is the right way. Or that whatever other people might say is irrelevant. Or that I can rarely be wrong.\\\\n\\\\nI wanted to shed light on this problem and highlight it and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using short stories as a medium. I did think about other mediums to portray this problem such as paintings, sculptures, poems, photos, music, and writing. However, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paint or sculpt. I take atrocious photos (ask my wife). I never wrote any music so let\\'s not go there. I do write poems but they are mostly in Arabic so that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach the audience I want. Plus I think poems are immutable and can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be translated without bleeding them in the process So the best route is to write. I know I\\'m not a good writer, as you will clearly see from this book, but I think I will be able to get my point across.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAmazon kindle\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B083H3N7C9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_jKPeEbKJHK6VR\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPayhip\\\\n\\\\nhttps://payhip.com/b/2MCl\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMobi (google drive)\\\\n\\\\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1al-G18prhf2xwfn3zPeV0I06rJrl_-vk/view?usp=drivesdk\\\\n\\\\nEpub (google drive)\\\\n\\\\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BFlcQUt-vzrlPJDSsOyirfcNn_tXULNz/view?usp=drivesdk\"",

This will have he same effect as next steps \\\\n\\\\nURL PARSE\\\\nAs you complete the phrase google.com and hit enter , the browser will parse and will figure out whether this is a url or a search term . It is a url so it will attempt to visit the website google.com \\\\n\\\\nHTTP or HTTPS? Determine the port\\\\nThe next step is to determine which protocol to use HTTP or HTTPS? to know that there is a protocol called HSTS list and we made a video about that tech. It is a local list of websites that only need to communicate with HTTPS. Google.com is in the HSTS list so we will use HTTPS so we now know the port is 443! We need to figure out the IP address so we can establish the connection\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDNS Lookup\\\\nTO find out the IP address we do a DNS look up .first we ask the operating system, because the domain could be cached, we find that its not . The OS then looks through the hosts file and see if there is a n hardcoded entry , there isnt .. \\\\n\\\\nNext the browser check if DoH is enabled DNS over HTTPS if yes then it communicate with the DNS provided (e.g cloud flair and ask for DNS) thats another TLS connection assume we are not using DoH The we establish an insecure UDP request to port 53 on the default DNS Configured on our router (could be 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1)  that in itself is a connection so we need to send the packet.. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTCP connection\\\\nWe know the IP we know the port! we can now establish a connection, we also know that we should also do TLS since its HTTPS and our client is smart enough to do TLS 1.3 so we will first do 3 way handshake and establish a TCP connection between 10.0.0.2 port random 1234 and 4.1.2.3 port 443 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTLS, ALPN, SNI\\\\nAssuming I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using the latest browser so it supports TLS 1.3 and my server also supports TLS 1.3, next is Client Hello. Client generates a public and private key, merges public and private key in DH sends out public and merged keys which cannot be broken in a client hello. It also sends the supported cipher suits (supported for symmetric key algorithms) If TLS extensions are enabled such as ALPN \\\\u0026 SNI the client also sends in the same request the host name google.com in the TLS client hello along with the fact that it actually supports HTTP2 (this might be different in Chrome since it uses HTTP/2 over UDP or QUIC) \\\\n \\\\nFirst Request GET/ \\\\nThe client is now ready to send an actual HTTP data, so it builds header GET / since that is what we want to send, puts the hostname in the header and other stuff, checks if there are cookies and puts them, the whole thing is compressed and sent as a binary format. The data is then encrypted with the TLS symmetric key and sent.. \\\\n\\\\nThe get request is then streamed into the HTTP/2 tcp connection and sent to the server. \\\\n\\\\nHTML Parsing \\\\nMake multiple requests css? JS? Multiple streams?\\\\nIf H1 then pipeline? \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xb0 Network Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUBSgBXilKhRMJ1ACqr7pTr\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x98 Postgres Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWGrOqslniFlRcwxyY94cjj\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9a\\xa2Docker\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWsD-rakNw1C20c1JI8UR1r\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xae Programming Pattern Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQV1emqxKbcP5esAf4zpqWpe\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xa1 Web Security Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU3YDMRSMvzflh_qXoz9zfv\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xa0 HTTP Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU6zO0drAYHFtkkyfNJw1IO\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x8d Python Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU_M83ARz8mDdr4LThzkBKX\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x86 Javascript Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWab0g3W6ZaDM6_Buh20EWM\\\\n \\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n \\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

I struggled to answer for a while but After thinking about it I discovered that both REST and Message queue does boil down to basic elements. REST being HTTP which is Request-Response and Message Queue being Publish subscribe. \\\\n\\\\nTimecodes\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n3:00 Where does request response pattern breaks\\\\n7:00 Response request pros \\\\u0026 cons\\\\n11:12 Pub/sub pattern\\\\n17:50 Pub/sub pros/cons \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n- [ ] Request/ Response \\\\n- [ ] Pros and Cons\\\\n- [ ] Publish-Subscribe Definition\\\\n- [ ] Pros and Cons\\\\n\\\\nReq/res\\\\n\\\\nBrowsing\\\\nFetch or XMLHttpRequest \\\\nSQL query\\\\n\\\\nPros\\\\n- Simple to implement (REST)\\\\n- Stateless (HTTP)\\\\n- Sync or Async (service and client) \\\\n\\\\nUploading a youtube video\\\\n- Compress video\\\\n- format video\\\\n- Notify subscribers\\\\n\\\\nUpload breaks down the video into small chunks and uploads each one\\\\n\\\\nOnce all successfully uploaded send a whole video to the compress service \\\\n\\\\nOne video compressed, the compress service sends to the format service and notifications service  \\\\n\\\\nIf you are only using pure request-response, The client will be waiting until all of that stuff is done and if the connection is broken or any failure happens you lose. \\\\n\\\\nPlus let\\'s assume You want to also add a feature where the video will need to be checked for copyrighted material.. so the compress service now need to make a request to the copyright service and make sure all of that requests return successfully \\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n- Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t scale with multiple receivers\\\\n- Creates extreme coupling between multiple services\\\\n- The client and servers have to be running to communicate. \\\\n- chaining, retries, circuit breaking \\\\n- Chain effect and circuit breaking (microservices)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMeet the publish-subscribe model \\\\n\\\\nOk, this is starting to sound like a commercial. \\\\n\\\\nPublish subscribe or pubsub for short is an architecture model where a publisher posts. a message to a topic (usually in the form of a queue) and clients optionally can subscribe to the topic and get notified when a new message is posted.\\\\n\\\\nUpload breaks down the video into small chunks and uploads each one\\\\n\\\\nOnce all successfully uploaded send a whole video to message queue or topic \\\\n\\\\nThe compress service subscribes to the topic. The new video will get received by the compress service, compresses the video and publish it back to the topic or queue as a compressed.\\\\n\\\\nThe notification and copyright service subscribes to the topic.\\\\n\\\\nRedis/kafka/RabbitMQ \\\\n\\\\nPub sub\\\\nPros\\\\n- Scales with many receivers\\\\n- Loose coupling(publishers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the subs, subs don\\'t know the pubs)\\\\n- Caching\\\\n- Work while publishers or subscribers are offline \\\\n- Great with microservices avoid chaining, retries, circuit breaking \\\\n- Pairs with event-driven architecture \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIs the pub/sub perfect though? \\\\n\\\\nDecoupling side effect is a serious problem. You just decoupled the sub from the publisher, how do you guarantee to deliver a message?\\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n- Message delivery issues (exactly once delivery ar least once) https://youtu.be/IP-rGJKSZ3s\\\\n- Network saturation- (depends on Pubsubs system) in push model clients might get overwhelmed, in pull model false attempts \\\\n- scaling is still an issue \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x98 Postgres Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWGrOqslniFlRcwxyY94cjj\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xae Programming Pattern Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQV1emqxKbcP5esAf4zpqWpe\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xa1 Web Security Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU3YDMRSMvzflh_qXoz9zfv\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xa0 HTTP Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU6zO0drAYHFtkkyfNJw1IO\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Software Architecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xb0 Network Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUBSgBXilKhRMJ1ACqr7pTr\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x8d Python Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU_M83ARz8mDdr4LThzkBKX\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x86 Javascript Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWab0g3W6ZaDM6_Buh20EWM\\\\n\\\\nSupport me on PayPal\\\\nhttps://bit.ly/33ENps4\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome,\\\\nHussein\"",

Thus the state transfer.  \\\\n\\\\nExample, lets say you are uploading a 5MB file in 5 chunks each is 1 MB in size and assemble it on the backend. The REST api end point takes the content along with a upload sequence, then persist it on a storage backend such as S3. Each chunk request could hit a completely different stateless server and the transfer will work fine since we are transferring the state (upload sequence) with every request.  The client maintains the state in this case. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRest constraints\\\\nClient/server architecture\\\\nIs there separation of concern? Can you upgrade your server without upgrading client?

This extra layer provide several advantages such as caching, load balancing, content filtering and much more.. We made a video about proxy vs reverse proxy check it out if you want to learn more about the difference. In this video we will explain the different types of HTTP proxies and the benefits and use cases of using each coming up. \\\\n\\\\nTransparent proxy (gateway) \\\\nHTTP insecure proxy\\\\nService Mesh Proxy\\\\n\\\\nTransparent proxy\\\\nIt is mostly used by the ISPs, clients don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know they are connected to transparent proxy. The way it works is it looks at TCP/IP layer 4/3 and forward it to the destination, it might do some content filtering based on the IP address or the port so it blocks certain sites. But thats pretty much it.  transparent proxy cannot know which pages are you viewing or your what youtube videos are you watching. It can block you from watching youtube all together but it cannot block you from watching lets say a specific youtube channel that is critical of the government ISP is located at. \\\\n\\\\nTransparent proxy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change the content. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHTTP Proxy (insecure) \\\\nThis kind of proxy is used alot, especially in service meshes like linkerd. This kind of proxy have to be configured in the client to use it. Each request will always be targeted to the proxy IP address / port. So when want to make a GET request to husseinnasser.com, and you have a proxy configured, when you look at the TCP packet for that request the destination IP and port is those of the proxy. The proxy looks at the GET request and specifically the HOST header and establishes another TCP connection to the actual destination on husseinnasser.com. So this kind of proxy maintains two tcp connections. Client to proxy and proxy to destination. The proxy have access to the content, it can block the website. It can know what exact page you are viewing. It knows everything because HTTP is insecure. Assuming youtube uses just HTTP, if you have a proxy setup it can block a specific channel or even video from being viewed.\\\\n\\\\n 1:05 proxy vs reverse proxy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozhe__GdWC8\\\\n2:50 TLS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlE5X1NlHgg\\\\n\\\\nThis country is now intercepting all HTTPS traffic\\\\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/kazakhstan-government-is-now-intercepting-all-https-traffic/\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome!\\\\nHussein\"",

In this video we will explain how TCP tunneling works, the applications of TCP tunnels and the pros and cons. Coming up! \\\\n\\\\n* TCP Tunneling\\\\n* Applications \\\\n* Pros and Cons\\\\n\\\\nTCP Tunneling\\\\nHere is how TCP Tunneling works. \\\\n\\\\nLets say your goal is to access a website that your ISP proxy blocks www.server2.com this is hosted on server2 on port 80.  Lets say there is another Server1 that you have access to and Server1 have direct access to Server2. So if you can make Server1 make the request on your behave to Server2 and somehow deliver the results back to you, you just created a tunnel between You and Server1. \\\\n\\\\nHere is how it actually works. \\\\n\\\\nYou create a legit tcp connection over a known protocol such as SSH between you and Server1. You then create a tcp packet that is intended for Sever2 so you tag it with Server2:80. Then you package that packet into another TCP packet intended for Server1! Huh ! Server1:22.   You then forward the packet over, your ISP police will see that there is a packet intended to Server1 on port 22. Proxy approves and forwards it over not knowing that you are smuggling content in that packet. Also the proxy cant even look in the content because its encrypted with RSA. Server1 unpacks the package, decrypt and discover that its an other tcp packet. Here is where the shady stuff happen. Server1 now looks and see that the smuggled package is intended for Server2:80, created a connection and delivers the package it, it changes the source ip to its self and keeps track somehow of that. Once it receives the package it knows that this package has to go back to tunnel. The client now have access to the blocked site! What does this look like guys? Yes you guessed it its a VPN. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally like smuggling content inside a package \\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\xa6 that looks legitimate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nServer1 and Server2 can be the same server\\\\n\\\\nThere are many types of tunneling\\\\n\\\\nLocal port forwarding: Remote connection, \\\\nSocks Proxy: forward pretty much anything (VPN)\\\\nReverse Tunneling : Expose local web server publically\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nApplications\\\\nVPN \\\\nSecuring an insecure connection\\\\nAnonymity\\\\nBypass firewall \\\\nSOCKS 4 proxy \\\\nredirect all your traffic regardless of the port to an internal proxy instead which tunnels it.

You can type in the browser www.husseinnasser.com , the OSI magic kicks in, client figures out the IP address of husseinnasser.com by calling the DNS which uses UDP. Then HTTP application layer makes a GET / request passes in the IP address and port 80 (default for insecure http). This creates an underlying TCP connection. GET / string among other stuff into the packet and send it over. TCP does its thing server receives GET / calls the appropriate process at the backend which could be just return index.html sets content type text/html and sends back big response for client. All of this obviously is plain text no encryption any kind and if you watched the OSI video we made you can tell that people can sniff/snoop packets and get packets they aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supposed to get\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHTTPS\\\\nWorks by negotiating a symmetric key so they can both secure messages. Watch the video we did on encryption. Before we jump to GET request there must be a handshake \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x9d that must occur between the client and server. The tricky part is exchanging that key. Same thing as above except port is 443 instead of 80. Remember once we lose the TCP connection we will have to renegotiate the key. But beauty of this is HTTP is stateless so it remains working just fine. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTls handshake \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x9d \\\\nThe original TLS handshake involves 4 roundtrips. A client hello which the client includes which encryption algorithms it supports (Both symmteric and asymmetric). The server receives the request then replies back with the server certificate which includes the server public key and also the encryptions that they will change to. The client receives the server hello, generates the premaster key, encrypts it with the server\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public key then send it over. The Server decrypts the message, gets the premaster generates the symmetric key finally tells the client that we are good to go. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTls 1.3 \\\\nTLS 1.3 involves much shorter and much secure communication using only deffie hellman as key exchange and just two round trips. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMore Resources\\\\nhttps://www.cloudflare.com/learning-resources/tls-1-3/\\\\nhttps://blog.cloudflare.com/rfc-8446-aka-tls-1-3/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xad Software Architecture Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXNP6mQchJVP3S-3oKGEuw9\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbe Database Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xb0 Network Engineering Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQUBSgBXilKhRMJ1ACqr7pTr\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xb0 Load Balancing and Proxies Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQVMeBmWI2AhxULWEeo7AaMC\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x98 Postgres Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWGrOqslniFlRcwxyY94cjj\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\xae Programming Pattern Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQV1emqxKbcP5esAf4zpqWpe\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x9b\\xa1 Web Security Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU3YDMRSMvzflh_qXoz9zfv\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xa0 HTTP Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU6zO0drAYHFtkkyfNJw1IO\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x90\\x8d Python Videos\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQU_M83ARz8mDdr4LThzkBKX\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x94\\x86 Javascript Videos \\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQWab0g3W6ZaDM6_Buh20EWM\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome!\\\\nHussein\"",

It ranges from your internal network starting from network card all the way to your ISP Internet speed. In this video we will discuss the definition of bandwidth upload vs download speed, the different usage patterns for normal web browsing, streaming, gaming, media production and cloud web servers etc and finally we will show an example of the whole thing.\\\\n\\\\nWhen your ISP gives you 80Mbs download/1Mbs upload bandwidth, this means 80 mega bits download which means your router (and all your devices) can receive (download) a total of 80 mega bits in a second at a time, and it can send (upload) 1 mega bit in a second. With your ISP can you pick and choose your plan that fits your usage.\\\\n\\\\nUsage patterns\\\\nWeb Browsing\\\\nMost people download far more than they upload. So the download bandwidth matter more than upload bandwidth. For simple web browsing the download incoming traffic is slightly larger than the outgoing one. You make a GET request to pull index.html, you get back the html content. Yeah there are some images but still not much of incoming. \\\\n\\\\nStreaming\\\\nThink about it when you watch a movie in Netflix you make a small request usually in few hundred bytes. But the data you receive (download) is huge. So streaming is constant large incoming data. While still outgoing traffic is minimum.\\\\n\\\\nGaming\\\\nThe bandwidth for gamers is really interesting specially who play online and it really depends on the game. a game might use the server authoritative model, where all the online players send their inputs and receive the final game state changes from the server. In that case the there is a constant upload, still minor but the download bandwidth is larger since state is usually bigger. Games can also use the lock state model or the client authoritative model, where all the clients send their inputs the server and the server just send back all the input from all players back to everyone so everyone calculate the game state locally. So in this efficient model, both the upload and download is quite small and its good for countries with low bandwidth. \\\\n\\\\nSome games require cloud saving which means upload speed is recommended. \\\\n\\\\nIn general latency is much better in gaming.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMedia production \\\\nYoutuber and you make 5 videos a day so you need to upload alot of data to the youtube server. So upload speed really matter, and download also matter because you will also consume alot.\\\\n\\\\nWeb servers\\\\nNetflix (which is hosted in amazon) they upload data far more than they download. So their upload bandwidth is more than their download bandwidth. All those movies and tv shows pushed to consumers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nExample\\\\nAssume you have bandwidth of 80mb/s download speed (which is 10 Mega bytes per second) and 1mb/s upload (which is 125 KB per second). You are connected to a web server which has 80Gb/s upload and 80Gb/s download bandwidth, which is 10Gigabyte per second. Lets say you want to download a 60GB file or movie (no streaming). It will take the server 6 seconds to upload that file however it will take you 1.7 hours to download it. Your ISP That is not entirely true though for TCP, which implement congestion control. UDP does not implement congestion control. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome!\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "DOS  attacks (denial of service) are type of attack on a server to prevent users from consuming a particular service, usually this is an HTTP web server.  This could happen by either saturating the bandwidth of the pipe going to the server or by bringing the server down to its knees so it stops taking requests all together. In this video we will learn about 3 different types of DOS attacks and explain each one by example. \\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n2:15 Bandwidth based DOS\\\\n10:13 Max connections based DOS\\\\n16:30 Vulnerability based DOS\\\\n19:30 Summary\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBandwidth based DOS\\\\n- Dos Sending Huge amount of data to a server with lower bandwidth from a client with higher bandwidth which ends up saturating the server pipe and queue up future requests, new requests will have to wait or perhaps denied service. Example, the attacker have 100mb/s bandwidth (upload) the server has 10Mb/s download. If the attacker starts sending 100 mb worth of data to the server, it will take it 1 second to leave the pipe. However, The server can only download 10 mb each second for processing because thats its bandwidth, so it needs 10 seconds to completely download that 100mb and process. In this 10 seconds the server is fully busy serving just 1 client. Other requests will not be able to even reach the server, they might get queued and they may never be executed. Thus denied service. It is important to know that the server must have an end point that actually accept such large data. Like upload file with no limit. Another example, is UDP where there is no connection. \\\\n-  Ddos this previous scenario is less likely since servers usually has much more bandwidth than a single computer. A common attack is to do a DOS in distributed manner. Assume a server with 1 Gb and client with 10 mb/s no matter how much data the client can send it can only send 10mb per second, and the server can go through them real quick. Example, the client sends 1GB, it will leave the client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pipe into 100 (10mb) means the client will take 100 seconds just to upload all the data because it can only sends 10 mb each seconds. And the server is processing it so fast it each second and it will still have enough bandwidth to process other requests(1000-10). But imagine 100 users with 10 mb connection each, all coordinate to send 1 Gb worth of data to the server at the same time (critical that its in the same time) 100x10 each second they can send 1 Gb in total to the server, the server can only process 1 GB per second so the server will not be able to process any other requests because its bandwidth is saturated processing this 1 GB from different place. Make it 200 users and you just clogged the pipe. \\\\n- \\\\n\\\\nMax connections based DOS\\\\nAnother type of denial of service attack is by somehow force the server to reach its max connections. The web server usually sets a maximum number of tcp connections so that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run out of memory. an attacker can perform a DOS attack to force the server to reach its max connection. once it does, it wont accept any more connections thus deny service of future requests. However it is not easy, web servers have good preventive measures to minimize  unnecessary tcp connections. So you cannot just establish a connection and ghost the server. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t your ex boyfriend. Server has good timeouts for connections that are idle, terminated or potentially harmful. However one possible attack is to establish a connection but send the data slowly so when the server tries to timeout it immediately reset the timeout and keep the connection alive! Assuming the max tcp connection is 200, Run your script 200 times and you just created 200 connections to the server so no new connection can connect. \\\\n\\\\nServers do preventive measures to prevent alot of connections from the same client. In this case you wont be able to execute the 200 slow connections, \\\\nDo this multiple times from different machines you reached the maximum. \\\\n\\\\nVulnerability based DOS\\\\nAnother way to deny service is to destroy the server all together. If an attacker knows a zero day vulnerability, like say a buffer stack overflow that can be executed on an input that completely overflow the stack buffer and overwrite piece of memory to either terminate the process all together or even worse execute malicious code to gain control over the server. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\nBandwidth DOS\\\\nMax tcp connections DOS\\\\nVulnerability DOS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome!\\\\nHussein\"",

Some of you guys asked this question and I thought its appropriate to make a video. \\\\n\\\\nSo Personally id like to think of a Load balancer as one of the applications of a reverse proxy. It is a special case of a reverse proxy. Lets us define what a reverse proxy is first. To define load balancer we need to first define what a reverse proxy is. And to define reverse proxy, we need to know what a proxy is! So lets start with a proxy \\\\n\\\\nA proxy is a piece of software that makes request to a server in place of the client. Servers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who are the client. \\\\n\\\\nReverse proxy is the reverse! The client doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know which server it is connected to. I recommend checking out the video of proxy vs reverse proxy to learn more. \\\\n\\\\nA Load balancer is a special case of a reverse proxy. Reverse proxy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be a load balancer. Load balancers must have two or more servers on the backend to balance the load, reverse proxy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to. Reverse proxy can be optimized to perform the following: \\\\n\\\\n1. Caching web acceleration \\\\n2. Canary deployment \\\\n3. Security against servers \\\\n4. Anonymous \\\\n5. Single entry URL\\\\n6. Load balancing\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome!\\\\nHussein\"",

    "desc": "One of the most critical properties of the REST Architecture (Representational State Transfer) is that it is stateless and the state gets transferred between the client and the server. I personally always found this to be confusing until I really learned architecture by actually using it. In this video, I will explain the state transfer in REST by example. \\\\n\\\\nIn a stateful architecture, the client makes a request to the server and the server \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremembers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the client. The next request from the client will be retrieved from the state stored locally in the server. The pros of this are the server will pick up where they left off with each request, so request throughput is higher in stateful architecture. Another advantage of the client can send less data through the wire too. The cons of this architecture are if the server is down, the request cannot be fulfilled and the client is forced to disconnect and reconnect again to another server anyway and go through the entire process.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, REST is a stateless architecture where every request is responsible to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as much information about the client as possible for the server to reconstruct the state from scratch. This mean that no matter what server the client hit, the request will always be fulfilled so you get higher availability. This is where the state transfer in REST came from. Disadvantages of this architecture is the client now sends more information through the wire, thus your application consumes more bandwidth as a result, this is less of an issue with the introduction of protocol buffers and HTTP2. Another disadvantage is the throughput goes down since each request has to wait for the state to \\xe2\\x80\\x9creplay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and get constructed. \\\\n\\\\nHope you guys enjoy the video\\\\nCheckout the other content of this channel\\\\n\\\\nwww.husseinnasser.com/softwareengineering\\\\n\\\\nHussein Nasser\"",

They have found me through my blog and linked a blog post I wrote back in 2009 on ArcGIS Server technology. I accepted their offer and wrote the book and 3 others that followed.\\\\n\\\\nThis makes me question, why did I write that original blog post? I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that one day a publisher will google that technology and find my post and make me an offer to write a book. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember why exactly I wrote that post but I knew that I was having fun doing it. Sharing my experience with the world through this writing always felt good to me.\\\\n\\\\nIn August 2017 I started a new series called Getting Started with ArcGIS Javascript API 4.x on YouTube. That series became really popular. The interaction on that series inspired me to write this book to discuss things I might have missed in that video series and to distill all my findings, knowledge into a book. So if you are new to the YouTube channel consider subscribing to check out more content over there https://www.youtube.com/igeometry\\\\n\\\\nToday, I decided to re-live the experience of writing a book. However, no publisher is backing up this book. This book is written from the heart, full of joy, from me to you. It is a brain dump of what I think will be a very beneficial work for you guys.\\\\n\\\\nAs of the time of writing this preface, I did not pick a title of this book. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m feeling good about this. I know the topic and I can imagine how the book will look like. However, I feel that picking a title will force my thoughts through a narrow path and thus limit the potential of what this book could be. Obviously, if you are reading this that means I have already picked a title.\\\\n\\\\nThis book is about building web maps using Javascript technology. I picked Javascript because it is a resilient light-weight technology that can run on both the server and the client, mobile, IOT and supercomputer machines. \\\\n\\\\nTraditional technology books discuss tools. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is how to load a web map in a browser\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is how to query the rest endpoint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is how to render a 3d map\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. You get a catalog of tools and what they do. There is nothing wrong with this format. In fact, it is a good reference. However, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any context when reading such books to take action and build something. It is like learning what is a hammer, nail and screwdriver does but these tools are useless if no one shows you how to build a table using these tools.\\\\n\\\\nI like to write my books by example, where I build an app and in the process explain the various tools I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m planning to use to build this app. Personally, I feel this is a better way of learning as it gives context.\\\\n\\\\nI hope you enjoy this book.\\\\n\\\\nWhat are we building in this book ?\\\\nWe will be building a web mapping application from scratch. For tourists, we are building an app that helps users locate landmarks. The app shows the landmarks in a map such as libraries, cafes, restaurants schools and much more. It has a search capability to search for landmarks where they will be highlighted on the map. It also shows the nearby landmarks within specific miles from current location. So you can answer interesting questions such as show me all libraries within 100 feet of this coffee shop or are there any liquor stores within a mile from this school? I will be providing you with the sample data which I created myself, this data is not real it is just sample. All we need is to write the application. The app will run on both mobile and desktop.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry if this seems like a lot. We will break down those functionalities into different chapters and slowly walk through each.\\\\n\\\\nWho this book is written for?\\\\nAnyone interested in learning how to build a web mapping application. Basic programming knowledge is recommended but not required. I will explain all that is required as we go through the book.\\\\n\\\\nSystem Requirements\\\\nI designed this book in a way so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t require a special or license to get started. I will be using a mac in this book but will include instructions for Windows and Linux. We will use ArcGIS Online free account to host our landmark data and ArcGIS Javascript API 4.x to write the web application. I will provide that data in GeoJSON format so we can upload it to ArcGIS Online.\\\\n\\\\nSoftware Requirements\\\\nAll you need on your machine is a text editor to write code and a web server to serve the static files. I will be using Node JS as a web server and Visual Studio Code as the text editor. We will take care of the download and installation of those two in chapter 1.\"",

All you need is a computer with a windows to learn programming in a fun way. We learn programming by example here,  our example here is to build a Pizza ordering system. \\\\n\\\\nWe are adding new functionalities to this program episode by episode and learn programming in a fun way as we go! \\\\n\\\\nSince I started recording GIS videos late 2014, you guys were asking me to start a vanilla series to just discuss programming in the same approach we were doing our ArcObjects. You guys were emailing me, mentioning me on twitter and youtube comments to do this. \\\\n\\\\nThis is for all of you. I sincerely hope you enjoy it, this is the first episode, will continue to post new videos whenever I find a gap. \\\\n\\\\nYou don\\'t need to know anything about programming to watch this series, this is where you start, all you need to get started is explained in the video. Follow this playlist, subscribe to the channel to get constant updates whenever I post new episode to stay up to date\\\\n\\\\nA new series of episodes to introduce folks to programming with .NET and specially VB.. So we will create form projects explain what a project is .. what is the output .. \\\\n\\\\nFirst episode we talk about .NET framework, installation,\\\\nwrite our first project that says Hello world! on a form \\\\nTalk about variables\\\\n\\\\nWhat do we need to start coding? \\\\n- Windows OS, 8.1, 7, XP, Vista , 10 \\\\n- IDE, Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop.\\\\nDownload from here\\\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44914\\\\n\\\\nStay Awesome\\\\nHussein Nasser\\\\nwww.husseinnasser.com\"",

We create an arcmap document and add the Bestaurants data to it, change symbology and prepare it for programming.\\\\n\\\\nWe explain the ImxDocument, IMap and ILayer interfaces in this video. We create a new button and add it to our toolbar, the button opens a new form that have a drop down list. We writes our first code that reads all the current layers in the map and populates them in the list. \\\\n\\\\nThen we work with the layers from within the form. We will learn how to hide and show the layer from the active view in the map and also learn that to apply these changes we have to call methods on both the document and map object in order to refresh and see the changes we do! \\\\n\\\\nInterfaces introduced in this episode: IDocument, IMap, ILayer\\\\n\\\\n====\\\\nFull .Net Programming with ArcObjects Playlist!\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrZs1rwmOwg\\\\u0026list=PLQnljOFTspQXqYsWJG8o-eJpGlvzww9lE\\\\n\\\\nPrevious episode with code \\\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrZs1rwmOwg\\\\u0026list=PLQnljOFTspQXqYsWJG8o-eJpGlvzww9lE\\\\u0026index=1\\\\n\\\\nBestaurants Geodatabase \\\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ywg4l7zj6cfwumd/Bestaurants.gdb.zip?dl=0\\\\n\\\\nThe Source Code as of the end of the Episode\\\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/7eh3dfbnl8yumv6/02-NETArcObjects.zip?dl=0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nStay awesome, \\\\nHussein Nasser\\\\nhttp://www.husseinnasser.com\\\\ntwitter: @hnasr\"",
