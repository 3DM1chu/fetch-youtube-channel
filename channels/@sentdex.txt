Methods that just access values are called value receivers and methods that can modify information are pointer receivers.\\\\n\\\\nText tutorials and sample code: https://pythonprogramming.net/go/\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

There are quite a few choices for Raspberry Pi operating systems, but most people choose Raspbian, which is a Debian-based operating system that is optimized specifically for the Raspberry pi. This operating system is also most likely to support other packages that you may already be familiar with from other Linux distributions, so it makes for a good starting OS.\\\\n\\\\nText-based version of this series: https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-raspberry-pi-tutorials/\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

If at any point you are stuck in this series or confused on a topic or concept, feel free to ask for help and I will do my best to help.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

We\\'re going to be covering logging in Python .\\\\n\\\\nThe idea of Python\\'s logging module is to make your life easier. Have you ever maybe added print functions/statements in your code at various places to note where your code is and what\\'s running? Then maybe commented it out? Maybe you got fancy and created a constant like debug = True, then had some lines like if debug: print(something). If this sounds like you, or if it sounds like something that you might find useful, chances are, you should be using logging instead. Maybe you haven\\'t yet needed to do such things, but, eventually you may find yourself in a situation where you do want to temporarily track what your code is doing, but not always. Using print can help in a pinch, but your life will be easier in the long run if you bake logging into your code early on. With logging, you can both output to console as well as saving to a file, all depending on varying debugging levels you can choose from.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

In this part, we\\'re going to talk more about the built-in library: multiprocessing.\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous multiprocessing tutorial, we showed how you can spawn processes. If these processes are fine to act on their own, without communicating with eachother or back to the main program, then this is fine. These processes can also share a common database, or something like that to work together, but, many times, it will make more sense to use multiprocessing to do some processing, and then return results back to the main program. That\\'s what we\\'re going to cover here.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

In this part, we\\'re going to talk about the built-in library: multiprocessing.\\\\n\\\\nLet us take a moment to talk about the GIL. The GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. What the GIL does for us is... hmm... well it serves as a sort of memory management safeguard. Sounds like a good idea I guess, but not really. The real problem is that, since the GIL has existed, people have built infrastructure around it. There are better options today, but ripping out the GIL would be catastrophic.\\\\n\\\\nAlright, so the GIL is here to stay for probably a while. What\\'s that mean? Python is single threaded. Even if you use threading, Python runs on a single CPU. If you have 4 physical cores, your computer probably thinks you have 8, and you\\'re using 1 of those 8, including when threading. All threading really lets you do is access idle threads, and nothing more. It\\'s not using more power, its just using idle power. If you monitor your CPU %, you might see that you\\'re only using 10 or 15%, instead of the desired 100%, or at least close to it.\\\\n\\\\nWell that stinks! What can we do?! Enter multiprocessing!\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

While there exists demo data that, like the MNIST sample we used, you can successfully work with, it is not going to prepare you for many of the hardships that large datasets come with, and you wont be able to try out many of the more interesting examples of what neural networks are capable of.\\\\n\\\\nThus, in this tutorial, we\\'re going to be covering the GPU version of TensorFlow. In order to use the GPU version of TensorFlow, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with a compute capability greater than 3.0. I had been using a couple GTX 980s, which had been relatively decent, but I was not able to create models to the size that I wanted so I have bought a GTX Titan X instead, which is much more enjoyable to work with, so pay close attention to VRAM on the card. 4 GB is what I had on my 980s, which gives you 8 GB total, but 4+4 in SLI is not the same as 8GB on one card, for example. You can use two cards at once, but this is not ideal.

In this tutorial, we are going to be covering some basics on what TensorFlow is, and how to begin using it.\\\\n\\\\nLibraries like TensorFlow and Theano are not simply deep learning libraries, they are libraries *for* deep learning. They are actually just number-crunching libraries, much like Numpy is. The difference is, however, a package like TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. But that\\'s not all! We can even distribute computations across a distributed network of computers with TensorFlow. So, while TensorFlow is mainly being used with machine learning right now, it actually stands to have uses in other fields, since really it is just a massive array manipulation library.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is a tensor? Up to this point in the machine learning series, we\\'ve been working mainly with vectors (numpy arrays), and a tensor can be a vector. Most simply, a tensor is an array-like object, and, as you\\'ve seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.\\\\n\\\\nInstalling TensorFlow via Ubuntu and virtualbox: https://pythonprogramming.net/installing-tensorflow-machine-learning-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

For a starting place for constraint optimization in general, you could also check out http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Constrained-Opt.pdf\\\\n\\\\nWithin the realm of Python specifically, the CVXOPT package has various convex optimization methods available, one of which is the quadratic programming problem we have (found @ cvxopt.solvers.qp).\\\\n\\\\nAlso, even more specifically there is libsvm\\'s Python interface, or the libsvm package in general.

Where we left off, we had just realized that we needed to replicate some non-trivial algorithms into Python code in an attempt to calculate a best-fit line for a given dataset.\\\\n\\\\nBefore we embark on that, why are we going to bother with all of this? Linear Regression is basically the brick to the machine learning building. It is used in almost every single major machine learning algorithm, so an understanding of it will help you to get the foundation for most major machine learning algorithms. For the enthusiastic among us, understanding linear regression and general linear algebra is the first step towards writing your own custom machine learning algorithms and branching out into the bleeding edge of machine learning, using what ever the best processing is at the time. As processing improves and hardware architecture changes, the methodologies used for machine learning also change. The more recent rise in neural networks has had much to do with general purpose graphics processing units. Ever wonder what\\'s at the heart of an artificial neural network?

Of the tutorials that did the training, testing, and predicting part, I did not find a single one that explained saving the algorithm. With examples, data is generally pretty small overall, so the training, testing, and prediction process is relatively fast. In the real world, however, data is likely to be larger, and take much longer for processing. Since no one really talked about this important stage, I wanted to definitely include some information on processing time and saving your algorithm.\\\\n\\\\nWhile our machine learning classifier takes a few seconds to train, there may be cases where it takes hours or even days to train a classifier.

We decided that we\\'re forecasting out 10% of the data, thus we will want to, or at least *can* generate forecasts for each of the final 10% of the dataset. So when can we do this? When would we identify that data? We could call it now, but consider the data we\\'re trying to forecast is not scaled like the training data was. Okay, so then what? Do we just do preprocessing.scale() against the last 10%? The scale method scales based on all of the known data that is fed into it. Ideally, you would scale both the training, testing, AND forecast/predicting data all together. Is this always possible or reasonable? No. If you can do it, you should, however. In our case, right now, we can do it. Our data is small enough and the processing time is low enough, so we\\'ll preprocess and scale the data all at once.\\\\n\\\\nIn many cases, you wont be able to do this. Imagine if you were using gigabytes of data to train a classifier.

Despite this, I have had no issues personally with adjusting for differences in balance by modifying trim on the controller. If you can, then you can balance a propeller by adding tiny bits of tape to the underside of the propeller to add weight, and you use a propeller balancer.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pythonprogramming.net/\\\\nhttps://plus.google.com/+sentdex\"",

The idea of thresholding is to further-simplify visual data for analysis. First, you may convert to gray-scale, but then you have to consider that grayscale still has at least 255 values. What thresholding can do, at the most basic level, is convert everything to white or black, based on a threshold value. Let\\'s say we want the threshold to be 125 (out of 255), then everything that was 125 and under would be converted to 0, or black, and everything above 125 would be converted to 255, or white. If you convert to grayscale as you normally will, you will get white and black. If you do not convert to grayscale, you will get thresholded pictures, but there will be color.\\\\n\\\\nWhile that sounds good enough, it often isn\\'t.

At this point, we\\'ve learned quite a bit about what Pandas has to offer us, and we\\'ll come up here with a bit of a challenge! As we\\'ve covered so far, we can make relatively low-risk investments based on divergence between highly correlated state pairs and probably do just fine. We\\'ll cover testing this strategy later on, but, for now, let\\'s look into acquiring the other necessary data that comprises housing values: Interest rates. Now, there are many different types of mortgage rates both in the way interest is accrued as well as the time-frame for the loan. Opinions vary over the years, and depending on the current market situation, on whether you want a 10 year, 15 year, or 30 year mortgage. Then you have to consider if you want an adjustable rate, or maybe along the way you decide you want to re-finance your home.\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the data, all of this data is finite, but ultimately will likely be a bit too noisy. For now, let\\'s just keep it simple, and look into the 30 year conventional mortgage rate. Now, this data should be very negatively correlated with the House Price Index (HPI). Before even bothering with this code, I would automatically assume and expect that the correlation wont be as negatively strong as the higher-than-90% that we were getting with state HPI correlation, certainly less than -0.9, but also it should be greater than -0.5. The interest rate is of course important, but correlation to the overall HPI was so very strong because these were very similar statistics. The interest rate is of course related, but not as directly as other HPI values, or the US HPI.\\\\n\\\\nSample code and text-based tutorial: http://pythonprogramming.net/joining-mortgage-rate-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\"",

In this tutorial, we\\'re going to be covering the application of various rolling statistics to our data in our dataframes.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the more popular rolling statistics is the moving average. This takes a moving window of time, and calculates the average or the mean of that time period as the current value. In our case, we have monthly data. So a 10 moving average would be the current value, plus the previous 9 months of data, averaged, and there we would have a 10 moving average of our monthly data. Doing this is Pandas is incredibly fast. Pandas comes with a few pre-made rolling statistical functions, but also has one called a rolling_apply. This allows us to write our own function that accepts window data and apply any bit of logic we want that is reasonable. This means that even if Pandas doesn\\'t officially have a function to handle what you want, they have you covered and allow you to write exactly what you need. Let\\'s start with a basic moving average, or a rolling_mean as Pandas calls it. You can check out all of the Moving/Rolling statistics from Pandas\\' documentation.\\\\n\\\\nText tutorial and sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net/rolling-statistics-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\"",

We have a few options when considering the existence of missing data.\\\\n\\\\nIgnore it - Just leave it there\\\\nDelete it - Remove all cases. Remove from data entirely. This means forfeiting the entire row of data.\\\\nFill forward or backwards - This means taking the prior or following value and just filling it in.\\\\nReplace it with something static - For example, replacing all NaN data with -9999.\\\\nEach of these options has their own merits for a variety of reasons. Ignoring it requires no more work on our end. You may choose to ignore missing data for legal reasons, or maybe to retain the utmost integrity of the data. Missing data might also be very important data. For example, maybe part of your analysis is investigating signal drops from a server. In this case, maybe the missing data is super important to keep in the set.\\\\n\\\\nNext, we have delete it. You have another two choices at this point. You can either delete rows if they contain any amount of NaN data, or you can delete the row if it is completely NaN data. Usually a row that is full of NaN data comes from a calculation you performed on the dataset, and no data is really missing, it\\'s just simply not available given your formula. In most cases, you would at least want to drop all rows that are completely NaN, and in many cases you would like to just drop rows that have any NaN data. \\\\n\\\\nTutorial sample code and text: http://pythonprogramming.net/nan-na-missing-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\"",

    "desc": "Welcome to another data analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial. In this tutorial, we\\'re going to be talking about smoothing out data by removing noise. There are two main methods to do this. The most popular method used is what is called resampling, though it might take many other names. This is where we have some data that is sampled at a certain rate. For us, we have the Housing Price Index sampled at a one-month rate, but we could sample the HPI every week, every day, every minute, or more, but we could also resample at every year, every 10 years, and so on.\\\\n\\\\nAnother environment where resampling almost always occurs is with stock prices, for example. Stock prices are intra-second. What winds up happening though, is usually stock prices are resampled to minute data at the lowest for free data. You can buy access to live data, however. On a long-term scale, usually the data will be sampled daily, or even every 3-5 days. This is often done to keep the size of the data being transferred low. For example, over the course of, say, one year, intra-second data is usually in the multiples of gigabytes, and transferring all of that at once is unreasonable and people would be waiting minutes or hours for pages to load.\\\\n\\\\nUsing our current data, which is currently sampled at once a month, how might we sample it instead to once every 6 months, or 2 years? Try to think about how you might personally write a function that might perform that task, it\\'s a fairly challenging one, but it can be done. That said, it\\'s a fairly computationally inefficient job, but Pandas has our backs and does it very fast. \\\\n\\\\nSample code and text tutorial for this video: http://pythonprogramming.net/resample-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\"",

We want to have all types of asset classes, so we\\'ve got stocks, bonds, maybe a money market account, and now we\\'re looking to get into real estate to be solid. You\\'ve all seen the commercials right? You buy a CD for $60, attend some $500 seminar, and you\\'re set to start making your 6 figure at a time investments into property, right?\\\\n\\\\nOkay, maybe not, but we definitely want to do some research and have some sort of strategy for buying real estate. So, what governs the prices of homes, and do we need to do the research to find this out? Generally, no, you don\\'t really need to do that digging, we know the factors. The factors for home prices are governed by: The economy, interest rates, and demographics. These are the three major influences in general for real estate value. Now, of course, if you\\'re buying land, various other things matter, how level is it, are we going to need to do some work to the land before we can actually lay foundation, how is drainage etc. If there is a house, then we have even more factors, like the roof, windows, heating/AC, floors, foundation, and so on. We can begin to consider these factors later, but first we\\'ll start at the macro level. You will see how quickly our data sets inflate here as it is, it\\'ll blow up fast.\\\\n\\\\nSo, our first step is to just collect the data. Quandl still represents a great place to start, but this time let\\'s automate the data grabbing. We\\'re going to pull housing data for the 50 states first, but then we stand to try to gather other data as well. We definitely dont want to be manually pulling this data. First, if you do not already have an account, you need to get one. This will give you an API key and unlimited API requests to the free data, which is awesome.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you create an account, go to your account / me, whatever they are calling it at the time, and then find the section marked API key. That\\'s your key, which you will need. Next, we want to grab the Quandl module. We really don\\'t need the module to make requests at all, but it\\'s a very small module, and the size is worth the slight ease it gives us, so might as well. Open up your terminal/cmd.exe and do pip install quandl (again, remember to specify the full path to pip if pip is not recognized).\\\\n\\\\nNext, we\\'re ready to rumble, open up a new editor. \\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\"",

We\\'re going to show the use of programming for things like simple algorithmic trades like moving average crossovers, all the way to utilizing things like machine learning. \\\\n\\\\nComputers can be used for really anything from high frequency trading to long term investing. \\\\n\\\\nComputers allow you to test all of your ideas through what is called back-testing.\\\\n\\\\nBack testing is where we take our trading strategies and apply them to historical data to see how they would have done if we had employed them.\\\\n\\\\nBack testing comes with some inherent flaws. First off, the usual warning about historical results are not indicative of future ones, and back testing also tends to ignore things like execution time, or how long it takes to actually make a trade. Depending on execution time and the order size, you\\'re almost certainly to experience what is called skid / slippage. Skid/slip is the change in price during an order, from the point of execution initialization to when you actually complete the order.\\\\n\\\\nAll that said, back testing is still a must, and you will find as we go through this series that back testing can become a reliable method for looking into the future, and we can also add risk metrics on top of it.\\\\n\\\\nSo, this series is going to go through automated trading with python for finance.\\\\n\\\\nIt would be helpful to have at least some background in Python, though I will do my best to make it not necessary. I will explain the code each step of the way, and, should you have any questions or confusions, I am always happy to help.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s get started. To do this series, we\\'re going to build everything on top\\\\nof a service called Quantopian. Quantopian is a web app that allows us to write pure\\\\npython code, it\\'s not a rendition of python, it is python, in their web based IDE, which is the editor we write code into.\\\\n\\\\nThey have a ton of batteries included so to speak, which means they have a lot of the modules that we\\'re going to be using. Modules are pre-written code that we can import and use so we don\\'t have to write a hundred thousand lines of code to do machine learning, for example.\\\\n\\\\nFor the newcomer to Python, modules can be a bit of a pain to acquire. Using Quantopian eliminates this pain completely.\\\\n\\\\nWe also want to use Quantopian because their back-testing simulation is very noob friendly. Quantopian is built on top of python, a bunch of other modules, and a module called Zipline, which is a back-testing module for Python. Zipline can be used outside of Quantopian, so you can learn with Quantopian and then protect your algorithm if you wanted to by moving off their website, but, for now, it will make things extremely simple.\\\\n\\\\nQuantopian also has a ton of high quality data that we can use. Normally, you will need to go and acquire this data somehow. There are some really great data resources out there, but Quantopian makes this super easy too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsample code: http://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttp://hkinsley.com\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\nhttp://sentdex.com\\\\nhttp://seaofbtc.com\"",

Targeting is done by looking at the target rather than needing to point your ship right at it and menus pop up when you look in their direction, rather than needing to press a key. \\\\n\\\\nThe cockpit feels very genuine and the immersion is superb. E:D is definitely a great game with or without the Oculus Rift, but, there is no question: The Oculus Rift dramatically improves the game. \\\\n\\\\nYes, on the DK2, the resolution is a bit grainy, making small text hard to read at times, requiring you to lean in to read it, but, aside from reading text, I find myself completely forgetting about the grainy resolution. It is highly likely this will not be the case in the consumer edition of the Oculus Rift as well. \\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re interested in space combat, then this is a no-brainer!\\\\n\\\\nhttp://pythonprogramming.net\\\\nhttp://seaofbtc.com\\\\nhttp://sentdex.com\\\\nhttp://hkinsley.com\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\n\\\\nBitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6\"",

Flask is a web framework for the Python programming language. A lot of people are curious to know what the differences of Flask and other developmental frameworks, especially compared to the Python frameworks. \\\\n\\\\nIn this video, we cover what Flask is and how it compares to other frameworks, then we talk about how we set up our development server. We are going to be using a real server here for development, not a local setup. \\\\n\\\\nWe do this because, if you are trying to learn web development, then you must be interested in a live, real website. The problem with working on a local instance is then you have to transfer everything to an actual server. You will find very quickly that things work very different when you leave your home computer. \\\\n\\\\nHosts that I recommend:\\\\n\\\\ndigitalocean.com: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d1c4c6e66979  (use these guys if you want just a small, cheap server $5/mo)\\\\n\\\\nlinode.com: https://www.linode.com/?r=b417bc672ff52d6c055fd7a56e024939c667b0fd (use these guys if you think your website will get more than 1k visitors a day, I prefer Linode to DO.)\\\\n\\\\npythonanywhere.com (use these guys for super easy setup, not recommended, however, for their downtimes, and some access restrictions as compared to your typical server.)\\\\n\\\\nSample code: http://pythonprogramming.net/flask-web-development-tutorial/\\\\n\\\\nhttp://seaofbtc.com\\\\nhttp://sentdex.com\\\\nhttp://hkinsley.com\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\n\\\\nBitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6\"",

Traditionally, working with data that is indexed by date is somewhat challenging with Matplotlib, but not when using Pandas!\\\\n\\\\nSample code for the series: http://pythonprogramming.net/python-2-7-pandas-data-analysis/\\\\n\\\\nPandas tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfHt4XU7vTm22xDegR0v0fQ\\\\n\\\\nhttp://seaofbtc.com\\\\nhttp://sentdex.com\\\\nhttp://hkinsley.com\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\n\\\\nBitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6\"",

Python lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed and manipulated. Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. This is what sets them apart and why you would use a specific one. Lists are usually more popular, since people want to be able to change them, but tuples are also useful when you do not want or need to change the data. \\\\n\\\\nIt should also be noted that Tuples are faster to process and iterate through, so this gives them a bonus, again, if you are not needing to manipulate them. \\\\n\\\\nSample code for this basics series: http://pythonprogramming.net/beginner-python-programming-tutorials/\\\\n\\\\nPython 3 Programming tutorial Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4\\\\u0026feature=share\\\\u0026list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M\\\\n\\\\nhttp://seaofbtc.com\\\\nhttp://sentdex.com\\\\nhttp://hkinsley.com\\\\nhttps://twitter.com/sentdex\\\\n\\\\nBitcoin donations: 1GV7srgR4NJx4vrk7avCmmVQQrqmv87ty6\"",

For programming, linux is just lovely when it comes to installing packages for just about whatever. I believe mac allows similar treatment, though I\\'ve not done it myself.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I was first starting out with Python, installing modules was one of the most difficult things, for a few reasons. Mainly, with windows, there are quite a few methods for installation of modules. you\\'ve got pip install setuptools, download and click\\'n\\'drag, or setup.py\\\\n\\\\nAt the time of starting Python, a large part of my troubles was that I didn\\'t actually understand the process of getting a module, and this is obviously very frustrating.\\\\n\\\\nPython is going to look in a few places for modules.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s going to be site-packages and the script\\'s directory for the most part. There are some other places you can use, but let\\'s leave them out of it. Knowing this allows you yourself to make your own modules, in the form of just a script if you want, putting that in the same directory as your main script, and then using import to bring it on board, you can also place multiple scripts in a dir and use that.

Usually, the higher the granularity, the better the quality of the data is. That said, once you pass a certain point, say 10,000 plots on a single graph, the eye can not tell the difference and processing is wasted. Instead, developers should program into their applications granularity adjustments depending on the window that a user is looking. \\\\n\\\\nThis will show you how to modify how many plots are actually shown on the graph, by averaging them in groups and only plotting up those averages. This will allow you to plot high granularity data sets without waiting for an hour for them to actually generate! They are not moving averages, so there is not lag in the line either, and all data is calculated backwards.\\\\n\\\\nSample code and sample data can be found: http://pythonprogramming.net/modifying-data-granularity-matplotlib/\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSentdex.com\\\\nFacebook.com/sentdex\\\\nTwitter.com/sentdex\"",

One of the largest that people are most familiar with would be facial recognition, which is the art of matching faces in pictures to identities. Image recognition goes much further, however. It can allow computers to translate written text on paper into digital text, it can help the field of machine vision, where robots and other devices can recognize people and objects.\\\\n\\\\nHere, our goal is to begin to use machine learning, in the form of pattern recognition, to teach our program what text looks like. In this case, we\\'ll use numbers, but this could translate to all letters of the alphabet, words, faces, really anything at all. The more complex the image, the more complex the code will need to become. When it comes to letters and characters, it is relatively simplistic, however.\\\\n\\\\nHow is it done? Just like any problem, especially in programming, we need to just break it down into steps, and the problem will become easily solved. Let\\'s break it down!\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we know we want to show the program an image, and have it compare it to patterns that it knows to make an educated guess on what the current image is.

Eventually, multiple web frame works began to appear, and Django became the most popular. There are many others, such as Flask, web2py, and bottle. Each framework has its own characteristics and should be considered depending on your project.\\\\n\\\\nDjango, Flask, and web2py are all great options. Django is the largest and most supported, so if you happen to learn by example, this might be the best choice. Django also just seems to have more documentation. Flask and web2py are both slightly more basic at their core. web2py doesn\\'t require much at all, which is why many prefer it. Django forces you into having a semi-complex website, where web2py does not. Flask is somewhere in the middle. That said, you can make very simple websites with Django, and very complex websites with web2py.\\\\n\\\\nIf you intend to have a content-management-driven website with a significant database, then Django should definitely be considered. If you want to go with Django, then this tutorial series might just be for you. In this series, we create a simple blog-like website, do some basic HTML5 design, and show how to add python code in the back ground and display the return of any script. In our case, the return is the outputted Matplotlib graph that our backend script creates. Below is a picture of the finished product. \\\\n\\\\nSample code for this series: http://pythonprogramming.net/python-web-development-django/\\\\n\\\\nSentdex.com\\\\nFacebook.com/sentdex\\\\nTwitter.com/sentdex\\\\nLaunching the website and the admin.\\\\n\\\\nsqlite part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ogGd8BAYYs\\\\nsqlite part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCi8wyT5Xes\"",
