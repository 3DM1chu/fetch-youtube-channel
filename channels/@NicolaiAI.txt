These ML workflow stages enable you to compare annotations from humans and models in a blind test, improving the quality of your training data and helping you detect disagreements or performance issues.\\\\n\\\\nConsensus stages create a collaborative environment where human labelers and AI models work together to provide accurate annotations for your dataset. By setting thresholds and agreement levels, you ensure that only the highest-quality annotations make it to the final dataset, saving time and effort in the process.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re looking to optimize your ML training data management, improve accuracy, and streamline your machine learning workflows, V7\\'s consensus stages are an essential tool to explore.\\\\n\\\\nTo get started with V7 and learn more about its features, visit:\\\\n\\\\nGet Started: https://www.v7labs.com/get-started \\\\nAbout the Consensus Stage: https://www.v7labs.com/product-update/consensus-stage \\\\nFind Out More: https://www.v7labs.com/ \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for courses and to extend your knowledge even more, check out this link here: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x89 https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/courses \\\\n\\\\nIf you enjoyed this video, be sure to press the \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d button so that I know what content you guys like to see. \\\\n\\\\n_______________________________________________________________ \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbb My AI and Computer Vision Courses\\xe2\\xad\\x90: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x95 Object Detection Course:https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x97 OpenCV GPU Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x98 SegFormer Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x99 Object Tracking Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/yolov8-object-tracking-course\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xbe Online Courses with Job Guarantee on Springboard (Save $1000 with: \\\\\"",

Their neural nets are now operating in vector space instead of image space which is just amazing as the results show. We are going to talk about the things they introduced at AI day and see some of the results.\\\\n\\\\nFull Video of Tesla\\'s AI Day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0z4FweCy4M\\\\u0026t=1s\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xe2\\xad\\x90Enroll in YOLOv7 Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/yolov7-custom-object-detection-with-deployment\\\\n\\xe2\\xad\\x90Enroll in OpenCV GPU Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/opencv-gpu-course\\\\n\\xe2\\xad\\x90Enroll in SegFormer Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/transformer-and-segmentation-course\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8eGitHub: https://github.com/niconielsen32\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8eLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolai-hoeirup-nielsen/\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\x8eTwitter: https://twitter.com/NielsenCV_AI\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xb5 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thecodinglibrary/membership\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xb5Channel Member for help with projects, private discord, and exclusive perks:\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpABUkWm8xMt5XmGcFb3EFg/join\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nI am currently also doing tutorials in Computer Vision and Deep learning, so if you are interested in learning more about the things that Tesla does and what I have talked about in this video, then make sure to check those tutorials out here on the channel as well.\\\\n\\\\nFeel free to comment if you have any questions about the things I\\'m going over in the video or just in general, and remember to subscribe to the channel!

We will see some examples of what the car sees when it\\'s driving around and how they use its cameras, sensors, and neural networks to make predictions for the next action to take. We will see what the neural networks do and how they are used for different kinds of detection at Tesla.

The purpose of using batch normalization is to make our neural network learn faster and be more stable.

We will talk about some different methods that can be used to reduce or remove overfitting and underfitting if it occurs after the neural network has been trained. In one of the upcoming videos in this tutorial we are going to cover Regularization in depth which is important to know when dealing with overfitting in a neural network.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for courses and to extend your knowledge even more, check out this link here: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x89 https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/courses \\\\n\\\\nIf you enjoyed this video, be sure to press the \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d button so that I know what content you guys like to see. \\\\n\\\\n_______________________________________________________________ \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbb My AI and Computer Vision Courses\\xe2\\xad\\x90: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x95 Object Detection Course:https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x97 OpenCV GPU Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x98 SegFormer Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x99 Object Tracking Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/yolov8-object-tracking-course\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xbe Online Courses with Job Guarantee on Springboard (Save $1000 with: \\\\\"",

We will talk about their total rewrite of their code to make the frames sequential where all 8 cameras are now connected together instead of doing predictions on each individual frame. This makes it possible to detect if obstacles are static or dynamic. We will see what the neural networks do and how they are used for different kinds of detection at Tesla.  One of the most important things for Tesla\\'s Neural Networks and their way to fully autonomous driving is their training process with their new 4D sequential frames from all 8 cameras at the same time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for courses and to extend your knowledge even more, check out this link here: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x89 https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/courses \\\\n\\\\nIf you enjoyed this video, be sure to press the \\xf0\\x9f\\x91\\x8d button so that I know what content you guys like to see. \\\\n\\\\n_______________________________________________________________ \\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa7\\x91\\xf0\\x9f\\x8f\\xbb\\xe2\\x80\\x8d\\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xbb My AI and Computer Vision Courses\\xe2\\xad\\x90: \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x95 Object Detection Course:https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x97 OpenCV GPU Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x98 SegFormer Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teac... \\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\x93\\x99 Object Tracking Course: https://nicolai-nielsen-s-school.teachable.com/p/yolov8-object-tracking-course\\\\n\\\\n\\xf0\\x9f\\xa6\\xbe Online Courses with Job Guarantee on Springboard (Save $1000 with: \\\\\"",
