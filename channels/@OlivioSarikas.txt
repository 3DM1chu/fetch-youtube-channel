The Illuminati Diffusion v1.1 Model is trained on Stable Diffusion 2.1 and brings very high quality. It also works with three negative Embeddings: Nfixer, Nartfixer and Nrealfixer. Nfixer is for general coherence improvement and always recommended. Nrealfixer makes the colors and light more photo realistic. Nartfixer will create more artistic coherence in your render. The epi_noiseoffset LORA is trained on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and will work with any SD 1.5 model.

This video is a sneak peak into the future of AI, and I hope you enjoy it!\\\\nThe Future of AI will change our lives. Here are 7 Answers to questions I have been given about the Future of AI. In the Future AI will have a huge impact on our cultures, jobs, lives. Many jobs will be created by the Future of AI. We can\\'t even imagine a Lot of these Jobs today. AI will also change the future of AI, Design, Architecture and Entertainment. A important Future of AI will also be the merging of AI, not just with out cultures, but with us. In the Future AI will be a important Element of how we learn, work and enjoy our lifes. Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-e 2 are only the most visible developments of AI.

Most of the Time fear and anxiety is our body talking to use. Our body tells us that we know too little about the situation. That we are not prepared to handle it with ease. \\\\nSo a easy way to handle fear and anxiety is to prepare more and make the tasks less challenging at the same time. Do what you know, and then add a little on top. Prepare as well as you can and then be open to failure. That way you know what is coming, you know what the result will be and if things fail, you limit the risk and it hurts less\\\\nLet me know in the comments about your experiences\"",

    "desc": "These 5 tricks will make you a better artist. Get better, enhance your skill, improve your art, build your network. Being an artist is not easy, but it isn\\'t hard either if you know the right steps. So today I will let you in on the 5 biggest secrets to become better. 5 Steps that every great artist has taken to become great. \\\\n\\\\nDoing things every day is very important not only to hold up your skill and improve upon it. Also to push our all the bad things and sort them out for the good things that happened. Believe it or not, but most artists create 100 bad works and only show you the 1 good work they made along the way.\\\\n\\\\nTime is a big part of that. Especially letting time pass and then look back at your own work with a fresh eye, more skill, and experience. This will help you filter out the things that didn\\'t work and learn from the things that went great by accident. \\\\n\\\\nListen to this episode to get even more great tips and tricks.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a free Behind the Scenes Episode.
