    "desc": "You NEED to be adding Mulligan Mobilisations to your home exercises for Frozen Shoulder. This simple addition can help get faster, better results, but very few people know about it. So, in this video I explain (i)which exercises to do for each stage of frozen shoulder, and (ii)how to add Mulligan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s techniques to Frozen Shoulder physical therapy.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:23 Freezing Stage exercises\\\\n1:32 Frozen Stage exercises\\\\n2:35 Mulligan\\'s mobilisations\\\\n4:26 Thawing Stage exercises\\\\n5:43 How long does frozen shoulder last?\\\\n\\\\n--------\\\\n\\\\nWHO GETS FROZEN SHOULDER?:\\\\nFrozen Shoulder is a progressive and painful restriction of shoulder movement that tends to happen in 40-60 years olds, especially women. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re more likely to get it if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve injured your shoulder recently, but there are other predisposing factors too. (Shoulder injuries, Immobilised Shoulders, Stroke, Heart Conditions, Thyroid Disorders, Parkinson\\'s Disease. Diabetes.)\\\\n\\\\nFROZEN SHOULDER SYMPTOMS: Symptoms of Frozen Shoulder are basically shoulder pain and severe restriction of the shoulder\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 especially external rotation, flexion and abduction. This will make it very difficult to put on a jacket and reach for things placed up high.\\\\n\\\\nFROZEN SHOULDER DIAGNOSIS: Adhesive Capsulitis (it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other name) is diagnosed when you are restricted in the direction mentioned above in symptoms and there is no difference to how much you can move you shoulder (active mobility) and how much someone else, like a doctor, can move your shoulder without your help (Passive mobility)\\\\n\\\\nFROZEN SHOULDER MASSAGE: Is there a form of massage that helps Frozen Shoulder? Not really. The muscles around the shoulder will get tight with frozen shoulder as the muscles tighten to guard against pain, but the aim of your treatment shoulder be more based on mobilising the shoulder joint capsule. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the underlying issue.\\\\n\\\\nFROZEN SHOULDER EXERCISES :\\\\n\\\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different exercises you should be doing for each of the 3 stages of Frozen Shoulder. (The Freezing stage, the Frozen stage, and the Thawing stage.) In \\xe2\\x80\\x98Adhesive Capsulitis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (as this condition is often called), the joint capsule around the shoulder socket gets inflamed\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and that leads to fibrosis: a thickening \\\\u0026 tightening of the joint capsule that restricts the shoulder.\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to add to the inflammation of the capsule by doing any treatment that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s painful because that can lead to more capsule fibrosis, especially in the first two stages. But you\\'ve got to maintain what mobility you can. \\\\n\\\\nTHE FREEZING STAGE: In the first stage (where the shoulder is getting more painful and restricted)\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 do pendulum exercises. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll help you maintain what mobility you can without inflaming the capsule more during this stage.\\\\n\\\\nTHE FROZEN STAGE: Then as the pain reduces but the restriction remains, start frozen shoulder stretches in four directions. Flexion, extension, abduction, and external rotation. You can use classic broom stick exercises here \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where you can add the Mulligan Mobilisations.\\\\n\\\\n MULLIGAN TECHNIQUE FOR FROZEN SHOULDER: By pushing the head of the humerus further back into the shoulder socket you can get more movement out of the shoulder. To do this we push back but also 30 degrees out, to follow the line of the Glenohumeral joint.\\\\n\\\\nTHE THAWING STAGE: In the final stage the range of motion slowly improves. Here you can start to use the muscles of the bad arm more to regain some strength that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost due to the frozen shoulder. This includes the classic finger walking mobilisations for frozen shoulder. \\\\n\\\\nHOW LONG DOES FROZEN SHOULDER LAST?\\\\nNow, 15 months is the average duration of all 3 stages, but hopefully you can reduce this substantially with the Mulligan variations. About 15% of the patients experience long-term issues, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to continue the exercises until you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 100%.\\\\n\\\\nHOW TO FIX A FROZEN SHOULDER THAT ISN\\'T IMPROVING\\\\nFor people that get stuck in the frozen stage, sometimes some kind of intervention can be necessary:\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 HYDRODILATATION is one option-where under local anaesthetic fluid is pumped into the shoulder joint to stretch the capsule to loosen it up. \\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPIC CAPSULAR RELEASE is another option, where a doctor cuts through and releases tight portions of the joint capsule. \\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 MANIPULATION OF THE SHOULDER UNDER GENERAL ANAESTHETIC is the last option but the manipulation is pretty aggressive.  \\\\n\\\\nHOW TO AVOID FROZEN SHOULDER:\\\\nRotator Cuff issues and dysfunction of shoulder movement heavily predisposes you to Frozen Shoulder, especially if you\\'ve had it before. So do these: https://youtu.be/9JN6dTBAyIU \\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises #frozenshoulder #frozenshouldertreatment #frozenshoulderexercises\"",

If you click on it, you can purchase it for no additional cost, but Amazon will give me a small fee... so small that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never actually even bothered trying to collect it.

And it makes us a bit more aware of overall posture. But they do very little for the neck \\\\u0026 spine positioning. And if anything, it makes our muscles weaker, because we are relying on the brace instead of our muscles. So, braces can be helpful in small doses only, an hour or two a day, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\\\n\\\\nUPRIGHT GO-2 REVIEW:\\\\nOut of all the electronic devices that assess the position of our spine and give us postural feedback, the Upright Go-2 is the best posture detector I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come across. (***Note: I have not received ANY sponsorship from Upright Go at all. In fact, I tried to score a free Upright Go-2 posture detector from the company, and no-one ever responded to my emails.) \\\\n\\\\nThe Upright Go-2 is a smart posture corrector that you stick on your upper spine that measures your inclination. Once you start to slouch it vibrates to remind you to straighten up. You still need to do exercises to mobilise, strengthen and stretch, but this little device helps to correct bad postural habits, especially at a desk.\\\\n\\\\nYou sit up straight, press a calibration button to set that position as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood posture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d default for the next hour or two, and it starts assessing your inclination. With the app, you can vary the amount time that it detects bad posture before it vibrates\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 how strict it is on the inclination before alerting you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and the intensity of the vibration. It even advises you on a recommended daily amount of usage each day that slowly increases. Just having it on made me more conscious of my position. I found myself looking down with my eyes rather than my head.\\\\n\\\\nWHERE TO PLACE THE UPRIGHT GO-2 ON THE SPINE: Some people said the detector didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice the bad neck posture, but I suspect that these people placed the device too low on their spine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d recommend putting it just below the neck so that it detects both your neck AND upper back position. \\\\n\\\\nSOME CONS OF THE UPRIGHT GO-2: It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not perfect. I read about connectivity \\\\u0026 glitching issues, and the app draining your phone battery, but I personally didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t experience any of those issues. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty small, so you have to charge the electronic device every day (or two at the most). You do need to buy extra sticky pads eventually too, but if you get the Upright Go 2 necklace (or \\xe2\\x80\\x98collar\\xe2\\x80\\x99) to help keep the device in place, the sticky pads last longer. It may not last forever, but by then your posture habits should be a lot better. It could be annoying if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving about doing things\\xe2\\x80\\x94where you need to bend forward frequently\\xe2\\x80\\x94so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more for when you are just sitting. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely recommend it for desk workers. I did not try the Upright Go S.\\\\n\\\\nPOSTURE PUMP / POSTURE PUMP DISC HYDRATOR: \\\\nI feel like the name of this device is deceptive. The details you see about the device don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t actually talk about helping with posture. It basically just increases the neck arch, and can be used with a pumping action. This can help some people with \\xe2\\x80\\x98military neck\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or neck stiffness, but it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help posture in my opinion.\\\\n\\\\nRESTCLOUD / NECKCLOUD / NECK STRETCHER:\\\\nThese actually feel nice but don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help with poor neck posture either. You could use a rolled-up towel for the same thing. (I tried it \\\\u0026 they were basically the same.) So the same result as the Posture Pump.\\\\n\\\\nBACK STRETCHER / BACK CRACKER:\\\\nI actually like this for mobilising the lower part of the thoracic spine, but for bad neck posture it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not much help.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #posture  #posturecorrector\"",

So, in this video I tell you who should be worried, who shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be, and what exercises you can do to stop knee cracking and popping.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:17 What causes knee noises\\\\n0:28 What the research says\\\\n1:02 Summary: When is knee crepitus significant?\\\\n1:22 How to reduce knee crepitus\\\\n1:47 Exercise 1\\\\n2:48 Exercise 2\\\\n3:24 What else can reduce kneecap tracking?\\\\n\\\\nVIDEO MENTIONED ABOUT KNEECAP TRACKING:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/g0qmx_0enAA\\\\n\\\\n-----------\\\\n\\\\nWHY DO MY KNEES POP AND GRIND?\\\\nKnee \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrepitus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as popping, crunching knees are officially called) is thought to come from fluid movement within the knee, tendons sliding past bony surfaces, or joint cavitations, like when people crack their knuckles. \\\\n\\\\nIS IT BAD THAT MY KNEES CRACK? AM I DAMAGING MY KNEES BY DOING EXERCISES THAT MAKE MY KNEES CRACK?\\\\nMost knee noises are fine and should not stop you from doing the things that you love. (Research in 1987 actually  indicates that 99% of the population gets some kind of knee noises.) BUT a large study in 2017 showed that crepitus can be an early warning sign of osteoarthritis... in people over 45 years of age, especially if they heard knee noises frequently.\\\\n\\\\nAnd anyone that has associated pain, swelling, or recent trauma, should get their knees examined too.\\\\n\\\\nIf you don\\'t fit into either of these categories then you DON\\'T need to be concerned with knee popping, snapping, catching, clicking, crunching, cracking, crackling, creaking, grinding, grating, or clunking.\\\\n\\\\nHOW TO FIX KNEES THAT CRACK. \\\\nA lot of these noises come from underneath the kneecap, so it makes sense to reduce the pressure under your kneecap by loosening the quadriceps. And making sure that the kneecap is running smoothly along it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s track, not rubbing against the outer edge of its groove.\\\\n\\\\nKNEE CRACKING PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES:  \\\\nRectus Femoris Stretch:\\\\nIf your Rec Fem muscle in your Quads is tight, your kneecap will be pushed harder against the femur. You can both test it and stretch it by lying face down on a firm surface. In that position, pull your heel towards your backside. If your heel touches your backside easily, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all good. If it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reach that far, your Rec Fem is too tight.\\\\n\\\\nOuter Thigh Myofascial Release:\\\\nIf the outer quads (Vastus Lateralis) or ITB are too tight, it pulls your kneecap to the outside too much. So doing a myofascial release on your outer thigh daily can help to reduce kneecap rubbing.\\\\n \\\\nA weak Glute Medius, or inner quad, or even flat feet can affect kneecap tracking too, so see the link at the top of this description for information on that.\\\\n\\\\nREFERENCES:\\\\nThe large research done in 2017 into knee crepitus.

Modified (active/moving) Mini Cobra\\\\nA nice way of combining both rotation and extension at the same time is by starting off in a Mini Cobra position from Yoga, but then moving the legs in a way that creates some rotation in the lower mid back.\\\\n--------------\\\\nRELAX THE MID BACK MUSCLES:  Rolling a tennis ball along the bands of muscles on each side of the spine against a wall is a great way to relax the muscles in the area.\\\\n\\\\nAnd Bird Dog exercises can be very handy to, to both strengthen the mid back muscles (more of a physiotherapy approach) and get some blood flushing through the Erector Spinae muscles to help relax them.\\\\n\\\\nFOR STUBBORN STIFF BACKS:  If your spine feels really stiff, and you think you need something a bit stronger to mobilise it, exercises that stretch the spine over a rolled-up towel can help enormously. This uses gravity to help.\\\\n\\\\nAVOID THE CAUSE OF MIDDLE BACK PAIN:  In the vast majority of cases, a slumped seating position is the cause of mid-back tightness \\\\u0026 soreness. So, to avoid it coming back, always sit right back in any chair to straighten the spine. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit in bed. \\\\n\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises #midbackpain #midback\"",

    "desc": "Anyone with ANY shoulder pain should check their posterior capsule. If the shoulder joint becomes tight and contracted it pushes the shoulder forward in its socket, leading to things like shoulder impingement, bursitis and rotator cuff tendinopathy. (The Teres Minor and Infraspinatus often get tight and contracted too, so all three need to be checked and released.) So, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best way to check your posterior capsule mobility and the best posterior capsule stretches to help prevent shoulder dysfunction.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:45 Posterior Shoulder Capsule Test\\\\n1:23 Sleeper Stretch\\\\n1:54 Myofascial Release Of The Posterior Capsule\\\\n2:26 Active Myofascial Release\\\\n2:57 How To Reduce The Intensity\\\\n3:17 Cautions\\\\n\\\\nTHE BEST PHYSICAL THERAPY SHOULDER STRETCHES:\\\\nRotator Cuff exercises are not the only thing you have to do if you have sore shoulders! Posterior Capsule contraction is a huge part of many shoulder problems. So, shoulder stretches like the Sleeper Stretch are crucial if you want to improve. But you can go one better. (Or two, in this case) Using a tennis ball to do a myofascial release of the Posterior capsule, Teres minor, and Infraspinatus while you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a Sleeper Stretch motion enhances the benefit dramatically. And actively using those muscles as you mobilise your shoulder makes this one of the best shoulder mobility stretches you can do.\\\\n\\\\nWHAT OTHER SHOULDER MOBILITY EXERCISES DO YOU NEED?\\\\nIf your shoulder blade doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rotate up properly all the movement has to happen in the shoulder. This is a massive cause of shoulder impingement. So, strengthening the muscles that upwardly rotate the shoulder blade is the most important thing you can do for shoulder flexion mobility. So, make sure you check out this video\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  https://youtu.be/9JN6dTBAyIU \\\\n\\\\nAnd a tight Pec Minor tilts the shoulder blade forward reducing space inside the shoulder joint too. A lot of people have tight Pec Minor muscles without knowing it so check out how to sort that out in exercise 1 of this video\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  https://youtu.be/dBa0QMTGTVc\\\\n\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises #shoulderpain #shoulderpaintreatment\"",

The most important muscles to strengthen for injury prevention are often the little ones, that many people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even aware of, like the Multifidus and the Deep Neck Flexors. So, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 5 muscles to strengthen for function that you need to include in your daily strength training workout routine (that you probably aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t).\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:41 Stronger Shoulders\\\\n1:42 Healthier Shoulders \\\\u0026 Neck\\\\n3:15 Stronger Back\\\\n4:26 Healthier Neck\\\\n6:05 Strong healthy hips\\\\n\\\\n----------------\\\\nRELATED VIDEOS:\\\\nThe 3 Most Important Muscles To Stretch. (That You Probably Don\\'t)  https://youtu.be/dBa0QMTGTVc\\\\n\\\\n4 Parts Of Your Body You NEED To Be Mobilising Regularly  https://youtu.be/G3h2xicWzVM\\\\n\\\\nOTHER WAYS TO STRENGTHEN THE GLUTE MEDIUS \\\\u0026 MINIMUS:\\\\nExercise 6 in this video on Lower Back health:  https://youtu.be/ynw7zr3dnUw\\\\nAnd this whole video on Hip Pain:  https://youtu.be/Q48eY3VlQF4 \\\\n\\\\n----------------\\\\nYOU NEED TO STRENGTHEN THESE MUSCLES FOR FUNCTION\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\\\n\\\\n1. SERRATUS ANTERIOR STRENGTH TRAINING FOR HEALTHIER SHOULDERS\\\\nFor healthy, strong shoulders you need good shoulder blade movement. If the scapula doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rotate up well it reduces the roof space in the shoulder, leading to things like shoulder impingement, shoulder tendonitis, and bursitis. The Serratus Anterior is crucial for good upward rotation of the shoulder blade. But it needs to be trained in a way that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t activate the pecs too much because overactive pecs reduces the space in the shoulder\\\\n\\\\n2. HOW TO TRAIN THE LOWER TRAPEZIUS FOR BETTER SHOULDER FUNCTION\\\\nThe Lower Traps work in conjunction with the Serratus Anterior to rotate the shoulder blade up. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also important to inhibit tight upper traps and Levator Scapulae. Exercises like \\xe2\\x80\\x98Y Holds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tend to engage the upper traps and Lev Scap too much, so something that enhances the rotation of the scapula while keeping the shoulder depressed is perfect.\\\\n\\\\n3. HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE LUMBAR MULTIFIDUS MUSCLE FOR A BETTER FUNCTIONING BACK\\\\nTo improve functional strength in your lower back, you need to strengthen muscles that stabilise and support the back, like the core muscles but also muscles that guide the movement of the spinal facet joints. The most important of these is your Multifidus muscle\\xe2\\x80\\x94the deepest muscle in your back. Fortunately, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty easy to do with Bird Dog exercises, BUT with a focus on two things: minimal pelvic movement and lengthy holds.\\\\n\\\\n4. DEEP NECK FLEXORS \\\\u0026 MUSCLES THAT RETRACT THE NECK. THE KEY TO NECK HEALTH.\\\\nForward head posture can lead to a neck pain, rhomboid pain, arm pain/numbness/pins and needles, and more. Poor neck posture is an epidemic so any strengthening routine for function and injury prevention needs to focus heavily in this area. Rather than just a simple Chin Tuck, I prefer to do cervical retraction exercises against gravity. The bonus with these two exercises in this video is that they can help mobilise the joints at the base of the neck too.\\\\n\\\\n5. HOW TO STRENGTHEN GLUTEUS MEDIUS, GLUTEUS MINIMUS (\\\\u0026 TFL) FOR BETTER HIP FUNCTION\\\\nNo strengthening routine for a healthier body would be complete without strengthening the lateral pelvic stabilisers. These muscles level the foundation of the spine and impact the whole function of the legs. A weak Glute Medius can lead to a whole list of issue low back pain, lateral pelvic pain, Greater trochanteric pain syndrome, hip impingement, gluteal tendinopathy, patellofemoral pain, IT band syndrome, and even ACL tears. Sidelying Leg Abduction with Internal Rotation is the most commonly given exercise for these muscles, but I find close chain exercises give much better clinical results. So, the exercise I include here is a standing version.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #strength #strengthandconditioning #strengthtraining\"",

    "desc": "Here\\'s the 3 most important everyday stretches for function\\xe2\\x80\\x94stretches you should do daily for crucial muscles, that when tight, cause significant musculoskeletal issues. Most people aren\\'t stretching, or aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even aware of all three of these.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:22 Pec Minor\\\\n2:24 Rectus Femoris\\\\n3:47 BONUS... ITB tightness\\\\n4:16 Deep Cervico-Thoracic Spinal Extensors\\\\n\\\\nSTRETCHES YOU SHOULD BE DOING EVERY DAY...\\\\n\\\\nPEC MINOR RELEASE \\\\u0026 ECCENTRIC STRETCH\\\\nIf Pectoralis Minor gets tight from gym, or poor posture, it pulls the shoulder blade forward, rounding the shoulders. This heavily predisposes you to shoulder problems because it \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 (i)reduces space in the shoulder joint, (ii)causes neck issues, and (iii)can even cause Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.\\\\nTo loosen Pec Minor, we don\\'t want to just statically stretch it. Firstly, we release a common trigger point in the muscle, with a myofascial release technique, so that when you then stretch it, you\\'re loosening the whole muscle. \\\\n\\\\nRECTUS FEMORIS RELEASE \\\\u0026 ACTIVE STRETCH\\\\nThe second muscle is the Rectus Femoris, which commonly gets tight in running, cycling and weight workouts. When it\\'s tight, it pulls the front of the pelvis down, increasing the arch is the low back, compressing the facet joints of the lower back. If you get a sore lower back when standing for prolonged periods, or walking around slowly, like when shopping, this is likely the cause.\\\\n\\\\nBONUS TIP: \\\\nITB AND LATERAL THIGH MUSCLE RELEASE\\\\nRunning, cycling, and gym workouts can also tighten the ITB and lateral thigh musculature. When these are tight, it can pull the kneecap to the outside, causing it to rub and give you kneecap pain. So, one little bonus tip here is that each time you use the legs heavily, always warm down with a 30 second muscle rub on the outer, lower thigh to avoid getting this very common cause of knee pain.\\\\n\\\\nCERVICO-THORACIC SPINAL EXTENSOR MUSCLES\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 ECCENTRIC STRETCH\\\\nWhen our mid back is flexed, but neck extended for long periods of time (think forward head posture), the deep spinal extensors of the neck \\\\u0026 upper back can become shorter, making it really hard to straighten up again. This creates a posture that compresses joints at the base of the neck\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 causing things like tight, sore shoulders (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccervicothoracic facet joint compression\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Rhomboid pain (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccostovertebral joint restriction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), symptoms down your arms (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccervical radiculopathy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #stretching #stretchingexercises\"",

    "desc": "Essential Daily Mobility Stretches. These areas of the body need to be loosened up regularly as part of a regular daily stretching routine (to keep healthy and for injury prevention). Our modern lifestyle, with so much looking down, and sitting slumped on couches or in front of computers causes a lot of joint restriction in the spine in particular. So, mobility stretches for the spine is a must as part of any mobility routine.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:28 Base of the Neck/Upper Back\\\\n2:56 Lower Mid Back\\\\n4:12 Lower Back\\\\n5:22 Ankle\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\nHow to Mobilise the Base of the Neck \\\\nhttps://youtu.be/0zcNvVnKjCA\\\\n\\\\nUpper Back / Rhomboid mobilising exercises:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/VpFBbxp67lE\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/SQGkw8psTIk\\\\n\\\\nMid Back mobility exercises\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/T8vKCXP7OSc\\\\n\\\\nHow to loosen the Lower Back\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/ynw7zr3dnUw (Exercises 1 \\\\u0026 2)\\\\n\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nUPPER BACK MOBILISATION STRETCHES\\\\nStretching exercises for the shoulders and base of the neck are a must. This is the most common area in the spine to get tight and stiff. Most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to mobilise the neck properly, and if you just do neck stretches like rotating your neck you completely miss the bottom section of the neck\\xe2\\x80\\x94where most people get restricted due to poor posture, stress, and text neck.\\\\n\\\\nShoulder blade tightness is incredibly common nowadays, so any mobility routine for the body needs to include exercises to loosen the Rhomboid area. The rib joints (Costovertebral joints) can be mobilised with rotation and side bending.\\\\n\\\\nLOWER MID-BACK STRETCHING EXERCISES\\\\nSlumped sitting posture is the leading cause of lower mid back tightness. So the lower thoracic spine and ribs need to be loosened regularly with a midback mobilising routine. Rotation and extension work well here, so a Bretzel stretch followed by a variation of a Downward Dog are the best exercises to loosen the lower mid-back.\\\\n\\\\nLOWER BACK MOBILISING EXERCISES\\\\nAll the sitting we do jams the bottom lower back joint, the lumbo-sacral joint. So daily stretches for the back need to cover this joint too.\\\\n\\\\nANKLE JOINT MOBILITY STRETCHES\\\\nYour ankle joint can become restricted without even getting sore. But if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t flex properly it can cause problems with foot pronation, knee pain, and even hip and back pain. Everyone needs to make sure their ankle joints keep free.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #mobility #stretching\"",

In this video, I show you how to mobilise three key parts of the spine, strengthen 4 crucial muscles for your back, and stretch several important muscles... using six exercises.\\\\n\\\\nJust strengthening your core, for example, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help if you have restricted spinal joints. But if you fail to strengthen important muscles like the Multifidus muscle, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to struggle.

It tends to get restricted from all the sitting we do so. So, any lower back exercises need to include something to mobilise it. This can be done by moving through it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s principal plane of motion, all the way into flexion and extension.\\\\n\\\\nLOW BACK PAIN RELIEF STRETCHING EXERCISES\\\\nRotation is another way of releasing stuck low back joints. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what chiropractors use.\\\\nIf the pelvis or lower mid back joints are restricted, that can be the underlying cause of back pain. The Bretzel exercises (Bretzel 1.0 \\\\u0026 2.0) are a wonderful way of loosening those areas, as well as the lumbar spine.\\\\nThe Bretzel 1.0 also stretches the Rectus Femoris muscle, a common muscle to tighten up from running, cycling, and weights. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tight you end up with too much curve in your lumbar spine, which compresses spinal joints, causing something called lumbar \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfacet syndrome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\\\n\\\\nBEST STRENGTHENING EXERCISES FOR THE LOWER BACK\\\\nThere has been over 200 research articles into the importance of the Multifidus muscle in lower back pain. It is the most important stabilising muscle for lower back movements, and recent research has shown that dysfunction of this muscle is strongly associated with lower back pain.  This muscle can actually deactivate\\xe2\\x80\\x94begin to work very poorly or sluggishly\\xe2\\x80\\x94after a bout of lumbar pain\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and stay inactive, causing chronic lumbar problems. Bird Dog exercises are a fabulous way of strengthening the Multifidus.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, weak Glutes are a major cause of dysfunction in the lower back. A weak Glute Max can lead to an increased lower back arch, which compresses spinal joints. And Glute Medius \\\\u0026 Minimus are needed to keep the pelvis level on each side. Both can be strengthened with a Single Leg Bridge, or one of its easier alternatives.\\\\n\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #lowbackpain #backpain\"",

In fact, stretching your hammies could even be making it worse! So, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how to sort out the four things that are likely to be the underlying cause of your hamstring pain or tension\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 once and for all.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:17 Underactive or Weak Glutes\\\\n1:11 Neural Tension\\\\n3:16 Short Hip Flexors\\\\n4:31 Not Stretching Properly, Knots, Fascial Adhesions\\\\n----------------------------\\\\n1. UNDERACTIVE OR WEAK GLUTES\\\\nThe first possible cause of chronically tight hammies is weak gluteal muscles. If the glutes aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t strong or active enough, the hamstring muscles will be forced to become overactive and overworked. (The hamstrings become \\xe2\\x80\\x9csynergistically dominant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.)\\\\n\\\\n2. NEURAL TENSION\\\\nThe second possibility is that what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re feeling is actually coming from the nerves running down the back of your leg, not the hamstring. If the nerves are getting caught by adhesions along its path, it can feel very similar to hamstring issues. Especially if you feel some numbness, or pins and needles in your leg, or if you feel it more at the back of your knee and calf when you stretch your hamstrings.\\\\n\\\\n3. SHORT HIP FLEXORS\\\\nThe third possible underlying issue is tight hip flexors, like your Psoas or Rectus Femoris. Tight hip flexors tilt the pelvis forward, lifting up the attachment of the hamstrings up, adding tension to your hammies.\\\\n\\\\n4. BEST HAMSTRING STRETCH \\\\u0026 HAMSTRING MYOFASCIA RELEASE\\\\nFinally, it could be that the hamstrings are actually tight and short, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got some knots or adhesions in the muscle, or you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing the right hamstring stretches (not isolating them properly).\\\\nMyofascial release of the hamstring muscles and isolated stretches of the hamstrings using eccentric contraction is what you need here.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nThe 4 Best Exercises To Get Quick Sciatic Leg Pain Relief\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/-7qo7u9fd8k\\\\n\\\\nThe Missing KEY To Fixing Anterior Pelvic Tilt\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/viRSZ7R2YaE\\\\n-----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #hamstrings #hamstringstretch\"",

Nerve pain down the arm doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just come from bulging discs, nerve compression from spinal joints, and carpal tunnel.

This is one of the best Thoracic Outlet Syndrome rehab exercises.\\\\n\\\\nTOS EXERCISE 3.  Thread The Needle variation with wrist extension\\\\nFor exercise 3, we stretch our arm behind us and extend the wrist slightly to slide the arms nerves along the arm. It acts as a nerve glide for TOS, but is great for posture too. Posture is a big key to improve this condition as it affects the relative position of the collar bone, 1st rib, and the muscles.\\\\n\\\\nTOS EXERCISE 4.

To test ankle dorsiflexion, place your toes 12cm/5 inches from a wall and try to touch your knee against the wall\\xe2\\x80\\x94directly over the middle of your toes and without lifting your heel. If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t touch the wall with your knee, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a healthy level of ankle mobility.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 1. Ankle Mobility Drill (for ankle joint restriction):\\\\nTo increase ankle dorsiflexion, you first need to start on the joint itself. Even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel tightness in the front of your calf you could well find that after doing this ankle mobilisation drill your ankle feels lighter and looser.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 2. Ankle Dorsiflexion Stretch For The Gastrocnemius:\\\\nHere we use Eccentric Contraction to stretch the first of the two main calf muscles, the Gastrocnemius. To do this the knee of the involved ankle is kept straight.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 3. Ankle mobility stretch for the Soleus:\\\\nFor the last exercise we concentrate on the Soleus portion of the calf muscles by bending the knee.

Towel Mobilisation\\\\nThis exercise mobilises stuck joints in the spine that can cause tight shoulders, scapular pain, arm pain, and forward head posture. Gravity helps you to release spinal joints at the base of the neck and loosen costovertebral joints. This is one of my favourite exercises.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 2. Traction Mobilisation\\\\nExercise 2 lengthens the spine, opening up the joints even more, taking pressure off nerves. It feels awesome! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the best Rhomboid pain exercises, but it also reduces the joint pressure that causes a lot of shoulder stiffness.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 3. Puppy Pose Retractions\\\\nI combine Yoga with McKenzie Retractions for Exercise 3 to create something that works on these problems from slightly lower down. If the mid back is really rounded (think hunchback/thoracic kyphosis), the spinal joints in the upper back and base of the neck have to extend more to compensate and this is what compresses the spinal joints and nerves that cause these types of symptoms. Fixing a rounded back is crucial to help fix tight traps and upper back pain.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 4.  Chin-Tucked Upper Thoracic Cat-Cow\\\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another yoga variation to reduce compression in the cervico-tharacic area. If a rounded mid back and extended lower neck causes most of the irritation then the opposite (extended mid back and lengthening of the back of the neck) is what we should be doing to fix Rhomboid pain, a pinched neck nerve, text neck etc.\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISE 5.  Lateral flexion\\\\nThe last exercise is aimed at one-sided pain in the arm, traps, or between the shoulder blade and spine. It opens the space for the spinal nerves by leaning away from the side of pressure. If the nerve pain in the arm is bad enough it can cause numbness in the fingers or finger pins and needles too. But just be aware that if the hand numbness or arm pins and needles is permanent, you should go to a professional straight away to get an MRI to make sure that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a disc protrusion causing arm pain. ESPECIALLY if you have weakness in the arm or hand.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #armpain #rhomboids\"",

The 4 Most Effective Exercises. (\\\\u0026 3 Causes)\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/_qqbq02R_W0\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\nTHE TWO BEST FOOT OVERPRONATION EXERCISES:\\\\nResearch on overpronation indicates that the \\'Short Foot Exercise\\' is the best to reduce navicular drop (a measure of how much the inside of your foot drops down). It strengthens the small foot muscles under your feet to help support the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. But we also need to support the inverters of the feet that help lift up the middle of the foot arch--mainly Tibialis Posterior. \\\\n\\\\nBut if you are missing out on these 3 other key parts to the puzzle, you may very well struggle to in your endeavour to correct fallen arches or over-pronation while running...\\\\n\\\\nFOOTWEAR IS IMPORTANT!\\\\nA lot of modern footwear has a narrow toe-box and the more pushed-in your toes are, the less pronation support you have. So, wearing shoes with a wide toe box is important. \\\\n\\\\nPlus, shoes with pronation support may be helpful to get some conditions like plantar fasciitis under control, but they make the muscles that support your arches weaker. So, try to wean yourself off pronation support footwear, slowly, once you get any injuries under control.\\\\n\\\\nANKLE MOBILITY\\\\nIf you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bend your ankle enough, the foot will turn out more and pronate to compensate. This may be due to restriction in the joint itself or tight calf muscles and needs to be corrected.\\\\n\\\\nGLUTE WEAKNESS\\\\nResearch shows that pronation exercises are more effective if coupled with gluteal strengthening exercises. Because when your glutes are strong, they externally rotate the hips, bringing the knees apart, reducing pronation pressure.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #flatfeet #overpronation\"",

There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 3 different types of back pain with running that people tend to get, so in this video I explain why people get runner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back and how to fix back pain while running quickly and easily.\\\\n\\\\n0:08 No 1. OVER-STRIDING \\\\n1:00 No 2. INCREASED LUMBAR ARCH\\\\n1:44  Tight Hip Flexors\\\\n2:42  Weak Glute Max.\\\\n3:34 No 3. WEAK PELVIC STABILISERS\\\\n\\\\n1. OVER-STRIDING/LOW CADENCE\\\\nOver-striding while running causes a jarring effect in the lower back that can cause inflammation of the lumbar spine. The key to stop over-striding is to increase your running cadence to 180 steps per minute so that your foot does not land heavily on the heel too far in front of the body.\\\\n\\\\n2. INCREASE LUMBAR ARCH/ANTERIOR PELVIC TILT\\\\nIf your pelvis is tilted too much the joints of your spine get jammed together with every step. This can come from 3 things\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\\\n\\\\nRunning Style: Try to run with your whole body tilted forward on a slight angle rather than arching your back.\\\\n\\\\nTight Hip Flexors: Tight Psoas or Rectus Femoris can cause back pain from Anterior Pelvic Tilt\\\\n\\\\nWeak Gluteus Maximus: The Glute Max muscles are notorious for getting weak and if they are not strong or active enough they will cause back pain during or after running.\\\\n\\\\n3. WEAK PELVIC STABILISERS\\\\nThe Gluteus Medius (and TFL) keep your pelvis level as you land on one leg. If these muscles are weak or inactive, they will fatigue and give you pain in the side of the lower back in the upper pelvic area. The Quadratus Lumborum Muscles can sometimes get sore trying to make up for weak Glute Medius muscles too.\\\\n--------------------------------------- \\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519 \\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises #running #backpain\"",

(Plus avoiding the most cause\\xe2\\x80\\x94slumped sitting posture.) Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the best exercises to help straighten a hunchback posture (\\\\u0026 rounded shoulders) that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve come across in 30 years of practice. \\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:11 EXERCISE 1. Active Towel Extension \\\\n1:23 EXERCISE 2. MODIFIED Downward Facing Dog\\\\n2:54 Exercise 2 Variation (\\\\u0026 Progression)\\\\n3:25 Causes of Increased Mid Back Rounding\\\\n\\\\nBoth of these thoracic spine mobility exercises include a dynamic component (movement to mobilise mid back joints) and a static component to stretch mid-back muscles. But the movement also allows for one of the most important aspects of creating change in soft tissue\\xe2\\x80\\x94eccentric contraction\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is more effective than static stretching.\\\\n\\\\nDo them in order. The towel exercise loosens restricted mid back joints and this helps the second exercise stretch the mid back more. Downward Facing Dog can do wonders for excessive kyphosis, but most people with a rounded mid back have a really stiff spine (and tight hamstring muscles!) so the variations I show are easier to do.\\\\n\\\\nBut no amount of exercises are going to make a difference if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t address the cause, and slumped sitting posture is the most common cause, so watch until the end!\\\\n\\\\nNow there are other causes of a hunchback posture. Scheuermann\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease is a partially hereditary disease that can cause a hunched back. Ankylosing Spondylitis and vertebral body collapse as part of osteoporosis are other possibilities, so always get a professional assessment if you experience pain or don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see results\\\\n------------------------------------ \\\\nThe 5 Best Exercises to Relieve a Stiff or Painful Mid Back\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/T8vKCXP7OSc\\\\n\\\\nThe 3 Ultimate Neck Hump Exercises\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 After 1 Year Of Trying EVERYTHING\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/C9QJIuIXAp4\\\\n------------------------------------ \\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519 \\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises #hunchback #kyphosis\"",

This can happen as a result of exercise overworking the pecs\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 but also as the clavicle heals after a broken collar bone, or AC joint separation. So, releasing these contracted upper Pec fibres is crucial in AC joint rehab.\\\\n\\\\nSC JOINT RESTRICTION CAUSING AC JOINT INFLAMMATION\\\\nIf the joint at the other end of the collar bone, the SC joint becomes restricted, this also causes a hyper-mobile AC joint.

You\\'re posture while using phones and laptops, the way you sit on the sofa or in bed, and certain sleeping positions, are common ways to cause these problems.\\\\n\\\\nHOW TO SLEEP WITH RHOMBOID PAIN\\\\nIf you lie on your side and your shoulder is pushed right forward, this will distort the rib cage a lot. There\\'s 3 alternatives to avoid this...\\\\nYou can lie on your back, you can lie on the other side, or you can continue to lie on that side but roll back off your shoulder. To do this bend your top leg less than the bottom leg when lying on your side.\\\\nI explain it in slightly different way at the end of this video...  https://youtu.be/Ceh4o0ykN8I\\\\n\\\\nSIDE RIB DISTORTION CAUSING SHOULDER BLADE PAIN\\\\nAnother way people can put their ribs out is by leaning on an arm while on the sofa, leaning on an elbow on an arms rest, or lying with your head propped on your hand. So, avoid those positions.\\\\n\\\\nPOSTURE CORRECTION\\\\nRounded shoulders also put the ribs in a bad position AND a forward head posture can irritate nerves that cause rhomboid pain. So, lift your phone up (with a supported arm) when using it instead of looking down at it on your stomach. Put your phone on your pillow and lie on your side to look at it in bed.\\\\n----------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #thoracicmobility   #rhomboids\"",

So, several years back I dedicated myself to studying how shoulders work and how to fix my dodgy shoulder. I discovered that rotator cuff strains are more of a symptom that a cause. If our shoulder blades don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t rotate upward enough when we lift our shoulder, or the scapula angles too far forward, the space inside the shoulder joint (the \\xe2\\x80\\x98subacromial space\\xe2\\x80\\x99) is significantly reduced. (This is the CAUSE of impingement in the shoulder, the cause of shoulder tendinitis, bursitis and strained rotator cuff muscles)\\\\n\\\\nTwo muscles, the Lower Trapezius and the Serratus Anterior, are the key to fixing both of these problems. They are notorious for being weak and inactive. But if we can activate these muscles and strengthen them, we take a huge amount of pressure off all the structures in and around the shoulder. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an explanation of how it all works and the solution to shoulder pain.\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\nA video dedicated to Exercise 1...  https://youtu.be/-2angJxxTPo\\\\n\\\\nA video dedicated to Exercise 2...  https://youtu.be/sBKRIbR0T5I\\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #shoulderpain  #shoulderpaintreatment\"",

I go through 4 IMPORTANT KEYS to give you quick, lasting results from a tight, strained hamstring.\\\\n----------------------------\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:13 Key 1\\\\n0:33 EXERCISE 1. Reciprocal Inhibition.\\\\n0:59 Key 2\\\\n1:33 EXERCISE 2. Ischaemic Compression\\\\n2:21 Key 3\\\\n2:36 EXERCISE 3.

Hip Flexor Stretches\\\\n5:51 Hamstring Injury Prevention\\\\n\\\\nVideo mentioned in the end of this Hamstring Rehab video with video on how to improve lower back health to prevent hamstring problems...\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/xOcCxkmL7ks\\\\n--------------------------------------------\\\\nTHE 4 KEYS TO GREAT RESULTS IN PULLED HAMSTRING TREATMENT\\\\n\\\\nThe first key to fast results after a pulled hamstring is to relax the muscle instead of stretching it. DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T stretch the hamstring because hamstring stretches can further damage hamstring strains. We relax the hamstring by (i)using the muscle that does the opposite motion (Reciprocal Inhibition) and (ii)compressing the contracted muscle around the injury site (Ischaemic Compression) using the first 2 exercises.\\\\n\\\\nKey 2. Keep in mind that research indicates that working the hamstring to very mild discomfort levels (about a 3 out of 10 on a pain scale) can give better long-term results that trying to rehab hamstrings pain free. \\\\n\\\\nWeak Glutes are a very common cause of hamstring injuries and gluteal muscles are very prone to become weak. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why people with excessive Anterior Pelvic Tilt tend to get hammy problems. So, strengthening your glutes is very important step in hamstring injury recovery and this is key 3.\\\\n\\\\nIf your hip flexors are tight, the hamstring gets overworked and this can be the cause of the strained hamstring in the first place. This is key number 4. So, if you find yourself with a hamstring tear or tight hamstrings, make sure you stretch your hip flexors to give you hamstring pain relief.\\\\n\\\\nHAMSTRING INJURY PREVENTION\\\\nTo prevent recurrence of hamstring problems you need to do five things...\\\\n\\\\n1, 2, 3. Strengthen weak Glutes \\\\u0026 hamstrings, and stretch your hip flexors with the exercises in this video.\\\\n\\\\n4. Reduce over-striding while running. Long strides while running put enormous pressure on your poor tight hamstrings. So, shorten your stride, aim for 180 strides per minute, and try to land on your mid-foot not your heel when running.\\\\n\\\\n5. Some ongoing hamstring pain and tension can be neurological in nature and coming from your lower back irritating nerves that run down the back of your leg. Even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any back pain. So, maintain good lower back health to help prevent hamstring strains.\\\\n------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #hamstringinjury  #hamstrings\"",

Shoes with a narrow toe box push our big toe in so we need to wear shoes\\xe2\\x80\\x94and socks--with a wider toe box.\\\\n2. The second cause of bunions is flat feet. When the arch of the foot collapses, the big toe is pushed towards the other toes. If you have flat feet, you can use orthotics that support the arch, wear shoes that are designed for pronation support, and do an exercise that helps support the arch of your foot.\\\\n3. The third cause of bunions is reduced ankle mobility. If our ankles don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t flex properly, our foot tends to turn out as we walk, which pushes that big toe inward. \\\\n\\\\nBUNION RELIEF EXERCISES\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\\\n\\\\nANKLE MOBILIZATION.\\\\nBy mobilizing the ankle so that it has more flexion\\xe2\\x80\\x94specifically over the big toe\\xe2\\x80\\x94we can reduce the \\xe2\\x80\\x98toe-out\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that causes\\\\n\\\\nTOE MOBILISATION\\\\nPeople with bunions have reduced big toe mobility (another cause of \\xe2\\x80\\x98toe-out\\xe2\\x80\\x99 walking), so to reverse bunions, we need loosen the big toe joint, especially into extension.\\\\n\\\\nTOE SEPARATION CALF RAISES\\\\nThis is a great bunion stretch to give you relief from bunions and reverse bunions naturally. By pulling the big toes together with a band we can stretch the muscles than pull the big toe in. By doing calf raises we help reduce fallen arches that cause bunions. We can do both of these at once!\\\\nSilicon toe spacers are another way of stretching the Hallicus Adductor (the muscles that shorten in people with bunions)\\\\n\\\\nSTRENGTHEN ADDUCTORS\\\\nLastly, we want to strengthen the muscles that pull the big toe out. \\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #PREVENTercise  #bodyfixes\"",

These 3 muscles often become weak, resulting in gluteal trigger points and sometimes even gluteal tendonitis.

    "desc": "How to fix dizziness or vertigo at home with exercises. Dizziness \\\\u0026 vertigo usually result from conflicting information coming from the inner ears, eyes, or movement receptors in your neck. These really effective exercises address all three areas to give you quick dizziness relief.\\\\n\\\\n0:00 Intro\\\\n0:11 How we get dizzy\\\\n0:39 NECK\\\\n2:06 EYES\\\\n3:32 INNER EAR\\\\n5:19 Other causes of dizziness\\\\n5:40 Medication alternative \\\\n---------------------------------------\\\\nTHE 3 MOST IMPORTANT TYPES OF DIZZINESS EXERCISES ADDRESS\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\\\n\\\\n1. DIZZINESS FROM THE NECK. (CERVICOGENIC DIZZINESS EXERCISES)\\\\nIf joints are jammed/restricted in your upper neck, or lower neck, this will throw out your body\\xe2\\x80\\x99s positional sense. (It can send information about your position that conflicts with your inner ear and eyes.) \\\\nIf you have a tight or stiff upper neck or headaches it more likely that your upper neck is the cause.\\\\nIf you have really tight shoulders, poor neck posture, or looking at the ceiling makes you feel dizzy, the lower neck is more likely to be what makes you dizzy.\\\\nSo, the first two exercises I give you in this video aim at loosening the joints and muscles in your neck.\\\\n\\\\n2. DIZZINESS FROM EYE PROBLEMS (VOR OR GAZE STABILITY EXERCISES)\\\\nIf your eye muscles are weak, or the connection between your eyes and the balance system of your brain is weak, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaze stability exercises\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be what you need. I show you how to test for this and how to correct it quickly.\\\\n\\\\n3. DIZZINESS FROM THE INNER EAR (BPPV EXERCISES)\\\\nSometimes stray crystals can find their way into the semi-circular canals of your inner ear. The crystal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement can confuse the detectors within the canal causing something called BPPV. (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.) If you get a real spinning sensation a few seconds after turning onto one side, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lying in bed, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s likely you have this problem.\\\\nI show you how to do the Dix-Hallpike test for BPPV, to see if crystals in your inner ear are causing your spinning or vertigo sensation. \\\\n\\\\nThe Epley Manoeuvre is probably the most famous treatment for BPPV, but research suggests that a much simpler technique\\xe2\\x80\\x94Brandt-Daroff vestibular training\\xe2\\x80\\x94is equally as effective (and less likely to cause distressing dizziness as you do it) so I show you how to do that.\\\\n\\\\nOTHER CAUSES OF DIZZINESS AND VERTIGO:\\\\nIf your dizziness continues, always get it checked out because there are more serious causes of dizziness and vertigo.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Meniere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease is one possibility and often comes with hearing loss, a blocked ear feeling, or a roaring tinnitus. \\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Stress can cause a floating sensation.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Blood pressure problems (high or low) can cause dizziness especially with a change of position like getting up from either sitting or lying down.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Medication side effects.\\\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Other causes include stroke and cancer thought, so seek immediate medical attention if you also experience a severe headache, fever, difficult speaking, weakness in your arms or legs, double vision, blindness, loss of consciousness, numbness or tingling, or a fever with your dizziness.\\\\n\\\\nNATURAL SUPPLEMENTATION:\\\\nIf your symptoms are chronic, try this natural supplement to help settle your dizziness: 240 milligrams of ginkgo biloba each day, can be as effective as leading medication to help settle symptoms. \\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nThe 3 Ultimate Neck Hump Exercises\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 \\\\nhttps://youtu.be/C9QJIuIXAp4\\\\n\\\\nRhomboid Pain.

If you have pain or restriction around one of the bony lumps at the back of your pelvis, chances are your Sacroiliac joint is stuck. It can even refer pain to the glutes, the outer thigh, or the front of the pelvis. (Baer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s point) So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how to crack your SI joint quickly, at home, using 4 techniques (extension, flexion, a muscle release, and internal/external rotation). \\\\n\\\\nEveryone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SI is a little different, so try each of these Sacroiliac loosening exercises until you find which works for you. In a lot of people, the results will be quick\\xe2\\x80\\x94but if you have chronic, long term SI restriction, just do all 4 each day. It should loosen up over a week or two. If any exercise causes any pain or discomfort, just be sure to move onto the next exercise. \\\\n\\\\nJust be aware that some people with SI joint pain actually have a loose, unstable Sacroiliac joint. If these techniques don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel good, or your SI feels a bit sore afterwards, you may need to wear a Sacroiliac Belt instead. (Very common issue in ladies that have been pregnant recently.) So, in this video I show you a quick test to see if your SI joint is a bit hypermobile. I recommend everyone does this test to be sure.

BUT it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just focus on how to relax neck muscles with a massage gun, it shows how to release the JOINTS at the base of the neck that CAUSE the neck pain, shoulder pain, \\\\u0026 tightness.\\\\n\\\\n0:00  Intro\\\\n0:44  Do this test first!\\\\n1:20  How to do Percussion Mobilisation\\\\n1:51  Step 1. Side Bending\\\\n2:16  Tips\\\\n2:27  Step 2. Rotation\\\\n2:41  Step 3. Flexion/Extension\\\\n3:05  Step 4. Protraction/Retraction\\\\n\\\\nThe underlying cause of tight shoulders in most people is jammed, restricted joints at the base of the neck. If you only work to relax the shoulder muscles with a massage gun, in many cases it will just come back. These spinal joints become stiff and restricted because of the hours of poor posture, looking at cell phones \\\\u0026 laptops all day, and stress. Adhesions develop in the sliding joints of the spine, making them move like a rusty joint. This is what causes shoulder tightness. \\\\n\\\\nPercussion massage with a massage pistol can help to loosen the joints at the base of the neck. BUT if you use the massage on the neck while MOVING the spine, the mobilization effect increases significantly. The key is to move through every plane of motion while the massager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vibration does it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s job.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, movement while using a massage gun not only loosens joints in the spine effectively, it also relaxes the muscles of the neck and shoulder very effectively too. Think about it. To help recover or rehab muscles, you usually move them lightly and repetitiously. Imagine doing that while vibrating the contracted muscle fibers.\\\\n\\\\nSo, whether you have a Theragun, Hyperice, Hypervolt, a Oyeet Nex massage gun, a Lifepro, Oprove m3 pro, or a good old Bob and Brad massage gun, this technique will relax and loosen your neck and shoulders much more than a static massage gun technique.\\\\n-------------------------------------\\\\nHow To Use A Massage Gun For Foot Relief (\\\\u0026 Plantar Fasciitis)\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/4ASDMxTGcb8\\\\n\\\\nHow to Use a Massage Gun on your Back, SI Joints \\\\u0026 Glutes:\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/Ee8DKRzc3Ew\\\\n\\\\nHow to Use a Percussion Massage Gun for Shoulder Pain Relief\\\\nhttps://youtu.be/BBq34WOZt4M\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #PREVENTercise  #bombproofbody\"",

Postural muscles adapt to this bad posture. So, how to sleep with neck hump? The most important thing to correct neck hump is spend an equal amount of time each day in a position with good posture. When we lie face up without a pillow, gravity straightens the spine, mobilizing the restricted spinal joints. In this position we can spend the time we need in good posture. However, if we lift up the mid back slightly, gravity accentuates the benefits of this sleep posture as the head ends up slightly further back than the mid back. The key to fix a neck hump is to do this gradually though! The body needs time to adapt.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we slowly reduce the size and remove the pillow. Then we start to raise the mid back with a folded towel to straighten the posture more. The towel sits between the base of the neck and the bottom of the shoulder blades. You can even use a diamond shaped towel fold or triangular folded towel to help fix rounded shoulders.\\\\n\\\\nPlease do note however, that in some cases of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuffalo Hump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDowagers Hump\\xe2\\x80\\x9d part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98hump\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is actually a fatty deposit over the spine.

    "desc": "Multifidus Activation: The Multifidus muscle is an extremely important lower back stabiliser because it controls spinal joints movement. Research has shown that dysfunction in this muscle is strongly associated with chronic lower back pain.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been over 200 studies on this muscle because\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 scientists have discovered than the Multifidus can actually deactivate (switch off) after a bout of lumbar pain and stay inactive, causing chronic lumbar problems. (You can actually see it in MRIs of people with recurrent low back problems. The muscle atrophies and is replaced by fat in people because of disuse.)\\\\n\\\\nMultifidus back pain? Does the Multifidus muscle actually hurt? Is that what causes your chronic back pain? No. The muscle itself doesn\\'t hurt. But Multifidus atrophy causes poor movement and function of the spinal joints, which then leads to spinal  joint inflammation, irritation of the facet joints and spinal nerve roots, and generalised muscle spasm in the lower back. So Multifidus exercises, and exercises that strengthen the deep back muscles are the key. Bird Dog Exercises and variations help activate and strengthen the Multifidus muscle so that the spinal joints are protected and the movement becomes controlled again.\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\'t need to strengthen the big muscles so much as you need to control the little muscles that are right next to the spinal because they are the ones that control spinal movement!\\\\n\\\\nSo, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got recurrent low back pain, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how to reactivate and strengthen the Multifidus muscle again\\xe2\\x80\\x94with one exercise\\xe2\\x80\\x94to make your back strong and stable again.\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\n7 Great Exercises for Low Back Pain \\\\u0026 Stiffness: https://youtu.be/gsVWo88oMkc\\\\n\\\\nThe Best Exercises For Scoliosis:  https://youtu.be/IZUdhGPWsVE\\\\n\\\\nHow To Fix Neck Hump (Forward Head Posture) \\\\u0026 Neck Pain:   https://youtu.be/VmV4IN6EJQA \\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #backpain #backpainrelief\"",

Foam rolling\\\\n4:57 Shoulder Blade problems with Thoracic Scoliosis\\\\n5:25 Can you straighten a Scoliosis???\\\\n\\\\nEXERCISES FOR SCOLIOSIS\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Does scoliosis treatment without surgery work?\\\\n\\\\nCan a scoliosis be corrected? Sometimes, depending on the form of scoliosis you have. 80% of people with a scoliosis have an Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis\\xe2\\x80\\x94a bend and twist in the spine that develops as we grow during our early teenage years. In these cases, the bones grow with an uneven shape. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change the shape of the bones, so in these cases the scoliosis cannot be straightened, but you can do exercises to keep this type of scoliosis healthy and mobile. But, other forms, like postural scoliosis can be corrected or improved. In these cases, physical therapy for scoliosis can really help. \\\\n\\\\nIf a child shows signs of scoliosis, they should always be assessed by a professional to ensure that the curve in the spine is not progressing. In severe, progressing cases, braces or even surgery may be needed.\\\\n\\\\nDO THESE SCOLIOSIS EXERCISES BOTH SIDES REGARDLESS OF WHICH SIDE YOUR SCOLIOSIS IS!\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of the side, shape, or level of your scoliosis, whether you have a C curve scoliosis or an S curve scoliosis, these scoliosis exercises should be done on both sides! The scoliosis stretches will STRETCH one side more because one side is always tighter. They will naturally STRENGTHEN one side more than the other because one side will struggle against the curve more. They will automatically MOBILISE one side more than the other because one side will be more restricted. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to know where the curves are, or even think about it. Just do them regularly to get scoliosis pain relief and prevent long term issues from having a thoracic scoliosis or lumbar scoliosis.\\\\n\\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nThe KEY To Fixing Shoulder Pain, Rotator Cuff Injuries \\\\u0026 Impingement For Good:  https://youtu.be/rk4k-pbN1ts\\\\n\\\\nHow to get rid of muscle knots in your shoulders, traps \\\\u0026 upper back:  https://youtu.be/b7F9eoHaU7Y \\\\n\\\\nHow to fix forward head posture:  https://youtu.be/VmV4IN6EJQA \\\\n----------------------------------------\\\\nSay \\xe2\\x80\\x98Hi!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on social media: \\\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BodyFixExercises \\\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bodyfixexercise \\\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bodyfixexercises \\\\nLinked In: https://www.linkedin.com/company/49086519\\\\n\\\\n#bodyfixexercises  #scoliosistreatment   #scoliosis\"",
