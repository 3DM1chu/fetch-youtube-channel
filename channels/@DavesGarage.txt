I would never do such a thing!\\\\n\\\\nThe ballast described was necessary to the technical solution already chosen, so a different origin (random data, the compressed works of Shakespeare, or whatever) would not have been any smaller or different. In other words, not a single byte more was consumed due to how the ballast was created.   It was a doff \\xe2\\x80\\x98o the cap to a sentimental product done in a way that neither added to nor took away from Windows in any way.\\\\n\\\\nTo reiterate, not a single line of code was ever added to the product related to this, and not a single byte additional was consumed by the data.  The only relation to the original Bob was in the seeding of the process that yielded the pseudorandom encrypted ballast data that we had to have anyway.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.   \\\\n\\\\nHope you enjoy the story!  BTW, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m nothing but proud of the work we did back then and this is one of a million stories from those days.  If there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an appetite for this kind of thing, please give it a like or let me know!  \\\\n\\\\nPlease share the video with someone you know that would be interested!  It\\'s a narrow topic so I\\'m totally dependent on your shares!\\\\n---\\\\nTLDR: Microsoft Bob was used to see the pseudorandom encrypted digital ballast used to fill some of the unused space on the CDs for copy protection purposes.  Credit due to Microsoft employee Raymond Chen for discussing this publicly on his blog and in a Scott Hanselman podcast as far back as 2007!\"",
