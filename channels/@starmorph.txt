It can adapt to new situations, learn from its experiences, and improve its performance over time. In the context of autonomy, an AI agent is designed to operate with minimal human guidance, allowing it to handle complex tasks and make decisions based on its understanding of the environment and its goals.\\\\n\\\\nAI Agent Definition 2 : An artificial intelligence agent is a learning system that interacts with its environment to achieve a specific goal by taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. In reinforcement learning, an AI agent learns to make decisions by exploring the environment, trying different actions, and updating its knowledge based on the feedback it receives. The agent\\'s objective is to maximize the cumulative reward over time, which leads to the discovery of optimal strategies for achieving its goal.\"",
